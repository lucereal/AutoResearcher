And to kick off this season, two of the most athletic but not good passers were added to the statistical mix (AR and Daniels\u2026and he\u2019ll, so far Caleb as well). Couple that with the return of guys like fields and Watson not being able to complete a pass, and things are off to a rocky start.\nI\u2019d be curious to see what the rb stats are on a comparative basis over the years without the QBs mucking up the data.\nTrue, and its also only two weeks of stats, so it'll be interesting to see how things play out. Totalyards in general are trending down which, regardless of QB runs, isn't enough to make up for the lack of passing yards. All of the injuries at WR certainly won't help either.\nIf you actually look at the starting QB for each team this year, the lower passing stats make perfect sense. I expect this trend to continue for a while, but maybe the run rate will go down as some of the younger QBs get more acclimated and the more established QBs get in a rhythm.\nWe have the rookie QBs:\nBo Nix\nCaleb Williams\nJayden Daniels\nYear 2 QBs who didn't start all of last season, so they're almost rookies:\nAnthony Richardson\nWill Levis\n\"Established\" Year 2 QBs:\nBryce Young (not for long)\nJordan Love (who played one game this year, and his backup in week 2 is not a normal starting caliber QB)\nCJ Stroud (although he is only increasing passing stats for the league)\nAnd the \"transition\" QBs (not the expected future of the franchise, but they have to start someone):\nJacoby Brissett (Maye)\nJustin Fields (Russell Wilson preferred starter)\nSam Darnold (what will happen with McCarthy if Darnold continues to be good?)\nGardner Minshew (what is the plan?)\nThe thing that may normalize a bit are the more established QBs who haven't put up great numbers so far:\nJoe Burrow\nJared Goff\nDak Prescott\nJustin Herbert (seems like an offensive game plan switch)\nKirk Cousins (yeah?)\nAaron Rodgers\nTrevor Lawrence (jury is still out...)\nMatt Stafford (team is decimated, so probably not going to change soon)\nDaniel Jones (hahaha)\nDon't we generally have that same situation every year though?  3 rookie starting QBs doesn't seem outside the norm for the last decade.\nHere is the complete dataset in a gdoc so you guys can take a closer look.\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\nMore posts you may like\nThe place to discuss all NFL related things\nWho are the NFL's best edge rushers?

            "summary": "### Fantasy Football Advice Summary - Recent Developments\n\nAs the 2024 NFL season progresses, fantasy football managers are navigating a landscape increasingly impacted by shifting trends in quarterback performance and injuries among key players. Here are the main developments and insights to consider:\n\n1. **Quarterback Performance Trends**: \n   - Early statistics indicate a decline in passing touchdowns, with only 66 recorded through the first two weeks of the 2024 season, compared to 105-110 in the previous years. This downward trend suggests a growing need for managers to reconsider their quarterback strategies.\n   - The integration of dual-threat quarterbacks has altered game dynamics. Notably, athletic but underskilled passers, including rookies such as Anthony Richardson and Caleb Williams, are influencing statistics that fantasy players must account for when evaluating player performances.\n\n2. **Injuries and Impacted Players**:\n   - Player injuries continue to affect fantasy outcomes significantly. For instance, Travis Etienne Jr. has scored negative fantasy points due to injury concerns, reminding managers to monitor injury reports closely as week-to-week developments can dramatically change player viability.\n\n3. **Emerging Strategies**:\n   - With lower overall passing yards and ongoing rookie transitions at the quarterback position, managers might want to pivot towards running backs and wide receivers who have shown consistency, as these roles are critical for scoring in a more run-heavy league scenario.\n\n4. **Checklists for Drafting Decisions**:\n   - Keeping an eye on the performances of established yet underperforming quarterbacks is essential. These players, such as Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert, might regain their rhythm as the season progresses, presenting potential buy-low opportunities for fantasy teams.\n\n5. **Community Insights**:\n   - Engaging with dedicated forums and discussions, notably platforms like Reddit\u2019s fantasy football communities, can yield valuable advice, strategies, and real-time updates from industry experts and passionate fans who dissect trends and player performances closely.\n\nBy understanding these latest trends and injury impacts, fantasy football managers can make informed decisions to optimize their rosters and adapt to the evolving challenges of the 2024 season."

Notably, **Trey McBride** stands out with significant volume, amassing 14 targets for a 38% share in his last game. Meanwhile, **Tucker Kraft** continues to perform reliably, not scoring below 4.2 fantasy points (Half PPR) since Week 11 of last season with Jordan Love at quarterback.\n\n2. **LaPorta and Kraft Decision-Making**: Managers are grappling with who to start between **Sam LaPorta** and Kraft, as both have drawn recent interest. There is an ongoing discussion about LaPorta's potential to 'go off' this week due to favorable matchups, making him an intriguing play despite concerns over trending performance. Trade suggestions are circulating, with some advising to package either player to strengthen other positions.\n\n3. **Waiver Wire Strategy**: With players like **Hockenson** emerging on waivers, discussions center around strategic pick-ups to enhance team performance. Hockenson's high snap percentage places him in a favorable position for the coming weeks.\n\n4. **Volume and Performance Assessment**: The analysis emphasizes looking for tight ends that are underperforming relative to their volume metrics. Managers are encouraged to seek opportunities based on yardage per route run and expected half-PPR points per game.\n\n5. **Market Adjusted Trade Values**: There's an uptick in discussions regarding trade values as managers look to optimize their rosters.
