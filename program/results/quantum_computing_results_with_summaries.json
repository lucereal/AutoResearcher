          "source_data": "Hi, this is Jim. This is one of those crossover shows. This is broadcast also on Hashtag Trending. It's an interview with Brian Jackson, who is one of the analysts at Infotech. It's not strictly about security, but it gives you a good foundation in some of the things that people are thinking about in IT, and there are some intriguing discussions about some issues that are related to cybersecurity. Hope you enjoy it. Have a great weekend. We will be back on Tuesday morning as we celebrate both Canadian and American Thanksgiving. Now here's the show. I think it's been more than a decade since I met this gentleman. When I was first at IT World Canada, Brian Jackson was an up-and-coming journalist. Even at that time, it was easy to spot the talent. Not only was he a great writer, but he had a strong analytical mind. As he progressed at IT World, moving from writer to editor, eventually to editor-in-chief, running all our publications, he continued to distinguish himself, not just as a writer and editor and a leader, but he also continued to be a driver behind a lot of our best analytics and research. So it was a bittersweet moment when he came to Fonanne and I to announce that he was moving on to work for Infotech, and we'd miss him as a strong contributor to the publication, and by that time, as a friend. Our loss was not just Infotech's gain, but it was also a gain for all of us in the industry who need solid research and analysis to help guide us or confirm that we're moving in the right direction. Now, we've met a few times at conferences, but we haven't had a chance to sit down and chat. So when Brian told me he had some new research he wanted to share with our audience, I said, hell yeah, and here he is, Brian Jackson. Welcome, Brian. Thank you, Jim, and that's a very kind introduction. I really appreciate all that. So before we get into our newest research with you, tell us who you are and what you do at Infotech. Yeah, thanks. I'm a principal research director at Infotech Research Group. I've been leading the tech trends research for the past five years now, and then I also do the CIO priorities report, Jim, and I have a lot of CIO clients that I do advisory work with. Through a program I call the first 100 days being CIO, and then for a number of other strategy discussions, a lot of them are revolving around emerging technology. So I'm able to come at IT from a mindset of let's research all the facts that are out there to inform what position I should take and what direction I should go in, rather than some sort of preconceived notion from having worked in the field and having different experiences. So that's worked out for me, and it continues to be a source of fascinating work. So what's your latest piece of research? We've got TechTrends 2025, and we're looking at a future where there's big stakes, but bigger risks ahead of us that we have to mitigate along the way. And whenever I do a TechTrends report, I'm looking at this sort of scenario analysis where IT departments, Jim, they love their controls, right? They're trying to think about how do we stop the business from shooting itself in the foot? We have to. I mean, that's why the IT department is there. It's your job. But I want to push them beyond that, right? So while we have half of our trends focus on mitigating the risks and putting those controls in place, which are crucial, we also focus on seizing the opportunities because these emerging technologies that we're talking about, they just hold tremendous value that if they're applied the right way, we could unlock more revenue, more advancement, doing better for the citizens that we serve. If we're a government. So I want to focus there too. Cool. So what are the big insights? You know, you're a journalist, don't bury the lead. What are the big insights you take away from this? Absolutely. Let me walk you through the six trends that we settled on for 2025. Organized into three themes, right? So I talked about that opportunities versus risks. We're looking at exponential AI. Now what AI is integrated into everything we do, well, almost everything. And if it's not there yet, it's going to be there sooner or later. So on the opportunity side, I'm looking at expert AI models. It's nice if we can adopt, you know, chat GPT that helps or co-pilot. This is good. But these large language models, Jim, they're becoming a commodity asset. They're cheap. They're open source. Anybody can tap into them. So it's no longer a source of differentiation. You have to have expert AI models that are trained on at least industry-based research or even better organization oriented information. So you get purpose driven answers for the problems that you want to solve. And then on the mitigate risk side of things, we're looking at AI sovereignty. It's like going back to cloud sovereignty, but there's more dimensions to it, right? So with cloud sovereignty, you know, we thought about, oh, we have to have the cloud storage on our shores, right? And that's what governments were worried about. But this matters to a lot of private organizations too. And with AI, there's more than just data confidentiality to worry about, which is a big concern too. We also want to maintain top performance controls and we want to make sure that the costs don't get overrun. Yeah. Yeah. So then we go through, I can go through the other themes here and I'll, No, let's, yeah, let's go through the other themes and we can go back for some individual questions on them. Sounds good. All right. So we've got pre-quantum foundations and we're looking at the early days, attaining quantum advantage with computing. It's not here just yet, but it's an important milestone of quantum utility is being achieved. And we're looking at a runway of maybe five years that some quantum computing vendors are predicting. That they will get to that quantum advantage, which means that certain industries, Jim, will just be able to solve problems they haven't been able to solve previously. That's a big deal. Now that's for some industries, for some leading edge organizations, they'll look at quantum computing, but everybody has to think about post-quantum cryptography, which is trend number four. Because we need to migrate our encryption before quantum computing and hack it and break it. It's a big problem and we got to get working on it. And the last theme of the report, Jim, is digital humans. We're looking at AI avatars. I've seen your deepfake, so you're into this. I have a deepfake too. I hate it, but it's easy to generate now. And we're finding a lot of legitimate applications for AI avatars and they're being deployed at a rapid rate throughout the economy. And then there's the negative side of that is the bad guys are using them too. So we need deepfake defense. How do we prevent being fooled by deepfakes? Like that poor guy in Hong Kong that wired $25 million when he thought his CFO was calling him, right? Everyone's heard that story by now. Yeah. Yeah. And it sounds like a lot going on. I will tell you, and I've seen some other research and obviously in my current job, I try to keep up with all of the trends. I think you're totally on the right track when you talk about that movement from controls to seizing the opportunities. I've been doing this for a long time. I always started with result station with DMR in the 1980s and 90s. And we were talking about results at that time. I think we finally have got that balance to the tipping point. People are still worried about costs. They're never going to stop. That's part of business. You sell something for a high price, you make it for a lower price. That's called business. But I'm seeing a much bigger movement of people talking about exploiting technology and getting opportunities and getting revenue from it. Are you seeing the same thing? We are. And the CIOs I talk to are very aware that it's no longer sufficient to be a backroom operator, right? We can't be an order taker that's reacting to business requests and business requirements. You have to be proactive. You have to be at the strategic level. And if the CIO wants to be sitting at the same table as the other executives, I think this is the opportunity to advise them on the capabilities that emerging technology brings to the table, talk about how does it align to the business strategy and guide them. Yeah. A friend of mine who's a great consultant once told me, he said, be where the business is and talk like they do. And what do they talk about? They don't talk about costs in IT. They talk about revenue. They only talk about cost in IT when you're coming to them and you haven't delivered what. I agree. Cool. I talk to CIOs that are thinking about, well, how do I justify this cost or that cost? And I say, don't talk about what costs you've incurred. Talk about the value that you've delivered to the enterprise and tell your costs to clear outcomes. Right. I still remember the CFO said to me, you know, Jim, I've got a stack of business cases on my desk. And if they were all true, we'd be operating at zero cost and making billions. He said, we're not. Something's wrong. I want to move on to this idea of AI because I think it's one of those areas. I have returned to doing some strategic consulting, but I'm doing it mostly in AI and cybersecurity. I'm going back to people and saying, stop talking about AI and start talking about what you want to get from it. What are your results that you want to get from it? Are you getting a sense that people are starting to get off of, it's cool to, what do I get from it? Yeah, you never want to be in that position where you're talking about technology for technology's sake. So often I do find myself saying something similar to my clients, Jim, because they'll say, they'll come to us and say, what do I use AI for? And I would say, well, what are your problems? What problem are you trying to solve? And that's always where the conversations should start. It's not, where should I apply this technology? We should always start from a position of what are the big problems and challenges the business is facing? Where could we potentially go for opportunities to earn new revenue, open up new markets, unlock capabilities that make us more productive. But that being said, I think that educating yourself about the emerging technologies that are available, learning about the use cases and even other industries, not only your own, because it can be eyeopening what other industries are doing with this too, and be quite inspiring. I think being aware of that and educating yourself is necessary because you have to know what is capable of in order to identify where it's going to be used, right? So it's a, it's sort of a balancing act of not being too dead set on using it because it's something that's cool, but using it because it's something that's actually better than what you're doing today. That's really good advice. I think, because we talk about this, don't fall after cool tools, but the reality is you need to be out there experimenting. And what are some of the ideas you've seen that have really worked or excited you? Yeah. Well, I think I'm thinking of a large Canadian retailer and turned on today, many organizations here today just to make sure that I don't cross any wires, but this large retailer, they have a great innovation program where they were cautious, right? So they identified with generative AI, one pilot that they would try first from a number of ideas. And they actually deployed something that was customer facing and helped their customers execute on their shopping, right? And it was the type of thing where you're shopping and there's a lot of details that you need to know about the product you're buying, but not everybody's an expert in that thing, right? So, you know, normally you're doing a lot of Google searching or you've got out some sort of product information sheet, it's stressful for the customer. It's hard to get done and it stops a lot of transactions. But with this chatbot, they were able to guide the consumer through the process, no problem, and right in line with the e-commerce application, educate them about what they needed to know. And they saw a great uplift in the number of purchases that it was driving, right? Which is the name of the game. So after that success, they said, okay, we've got one business use case here, prove it. Let's go back to the other ideas that we had, because they were pretty good too. We might've prioritized this one to start with, but there were other ideas there that may be worth developing. And if this technology works in one area, maybe it'll work for other areas. And now they're going through implementations of AI for training and AI for back office optimization. And I think that's what is going to happen next year is we'll get over that first pilot. People will be, see that there is business value there. And then suddenly it'll be applied in many different areas. Yeah. And I think that's the way to do it. I used to do something similar with my own clients and I would say, pick little things that are under the radar, but they're bucket people and find those things you can do because then you can build some credibility. I also told him to try several things at the same time because, and I think this is a good way sort of by stealth because one of them might fail. Nothing, you know, two of them might be okay. One of them might knock it out of the park, you know? So it's sort of like how I've stayed married this long. I lower people's expectations, particularly my wife's. Yeah. Smart strategy for a lot of different things. Yeah. So let's talk about these expert AI models. I'm fascinated by this. I think this is the future of AI is intelligent agents that can cooperate and collaborate. And I think a lot of people are starting to see this. And what's your picture of that? What does the research tell you? What are you thinking about? Let me start with an example here too, because I think this really illustrates it when you see it in action in the real world. I think we're all familiar with Moderna, the company that, one of the companies that developed a vaccine. Actually many of us took during the COVID time. And did you know that that spike vax vaccine that Moderna developed was its first ever product to market? No, I didn't know that at all. This was their first vaccine? Yeah, that's right. That mRNA delivery mechanism. We all remember that innovation and it was something they developed, but spike vax was the first time that they actually commercialized a product. So the company is looking at that success and saying, let's do more of that and a lot more of it, a lot faster. So their goal over the next five years is to launch 15 new products to market. And how are they going to accelerate that with AI? So they've got chat GPT enterprise, they deployed it and the way they encourage their employees to do is go and make their own chat bots, just like you and I can do with the custom GPT on the consumer version of the tool. And the employees are doing it. So for example, one chat bot is called Dose ID. And what it does is it pours through Moderna's vast research and it's looking at a pharmaceutical question of what's the right amount of the active ingredient to put into one dose. So when you're deciding on the vaccine, for example, you have to say, well, how much of that, what's the size, how many milliliters is in one dose? What's the right number? And it'll make recommendations to the researchers. And of course they get to review that. There's a human in the loop here. We're not automating this away, but it's data that they can review and they can visualize it and they can see how it got to that conclusion. And that's hugely helpful for them. And then in another department, the legal department, they created a chat bot that does contract reviews. So they can upload their contracts and ask questions about it and see if they're covered for their mitigations, the risks they want to avoid, and that's really helpful and time-saving for them. So it just is one example of a company that's sort of enabling their employees with AI in a way that doesn't require you to code, but is incredibly powerful and brings the capability to bear directly on your business process with the information that you need to work with. I think you pointed it out as this idea of in the early stages, let's focus on augmentation. Let's focus on helping the people and never letting them step away from responsibility, but to help them with either the difficult tasks or the things that they'll never get to. You know, a lot of people say, well, AI makes mistakes. They're saying, give me a thousand documents to read. I'm going to make a mistake. Sorry. We better have a better system than depending on a human to read a thousand documents. So you know, at the same time, if we're augmenting, I think we probably can explore more. And it's funny because there's some stats I got to produce the daily podcasts. I read a real, I read a lot of news. And one of the things I saw today and it just lit up with me was the number of people who've now figured out they, they laid off people too quickly or they never were laying them off because productivity was getting so great with AI. There's a whole hiring binge starting in India and it'll probably come back here as well because people jumped too fast to get rid of people. I think that's a mistake that you can make. What do you advise your clients to do when they're talking about dealing with the issues of how should I be dealing with people and, and communicating with them? Yeah, it's all about education and training to your point there about this fear of AI replacing us. Let's focus on using AI as a way to be better at what we do and to augment our jobs and to actually give you more time back in your day. I think that most people, you know, since the pandemic, everybody sort of feels like they're over capacity, that they're stressed out, that they can't keep up. And AI can be one tool that you use to do certain things more quickly or more effectively. And you look at some of the examples of how it's being deployed. Like let's look at call centers, for example, right? So a lot of people are, you know, there is the route where there's AI agents with synthetic voices even, but Jim, when do you get an AI agent and you can tell it's a robot on the other end? How long are you really going to spend talking to that robot generally? It depends on how useful they are. You know, I'd prefer to talk to a chat bot that can search and give me the stuff right away rather than a human who I can't get, I've got to wait 45 minutes for, who's going to read a manual back to me anyway. So on that level, I'm there. And I think, you know, I went onto Apple's and I was, you pay three times as much to have an Apple computer. I expect really good service. And I got on there and I was AI and I did the same reaction. And I went, Oh God, not you guys. Turns out their AI chat bot is just perfect. It can schedule a meeting. It can do things. And everybody at Apple answers stuff from a manual anyway. They read the manual. They do exactly what Apple tells them to do. So that for me is fast. But I think the best ones I've seen are when you need to talk to a person and I've dealt with one of them. I was dealing with ground news. little newsletter that comes out and it gives you a really good look at what's happening in the world and I use it a lot for research so it'll tell you whether an article is left-leaning, whether it's right-leaning, whether it's center, how true it is, so they really assemble a lot of different articles from a lot of different topics and show you all of the news that's out there. So I contact them and of course they've got an automated thing that you can use but out of nowhere a person contacted me said we understand that you've had a problem we'd like to help you and I said are you a bot and she said no I'm a real person and I went oh and that's the type of thing I think that people can have a response yes there could be an automated response but there could also be a real person this is the crazy thing about ground news I just love them to death I'm nine dollars a year in my subscription it's not costly but they still found the time to say pay attention that person that person needs a personal response the rest of it we can automate absolutely the right thing to do so that's great only that you can reach a person yeah I find I'm free to just to do whatever I want yeah I agree with you where I will prefer AI as long as it's I feel like it's effective and I'm getting the problem solved but often I find that if I have a little bit more of a complicated problem we get two layers deep and it's just going nowhere and then I'm like okay how do I get to a human so one interesting deployment for AI in the call centers is a pairing so you still have human agents answering the phone or maybe they're behind an initial intake process but a person is talking to the customer so you have the call center agent you have the customer and the call center agent is seeing the AI generated responses on their screen so the AI is listening to the customer suggesting to the human here's how you might answer this and then that contact center person can use their judgment right is this the right response or does it actually require something else in this robot it's not telling me where I need to go and it's way better than conversation branching right which was more difficult and sometimes led you into niche places that you couldn't back out of and it's just a perfect union should be yeah yeah I don't want to let you get away without talk talking about quantum but I do want to finish one last thing in AI and that's AI sovereignty this this idea of it's because it is double-layered on one you have the physical security and sovereignty and ownership of your data the other is you have whether AI can learn from your data and I think those are the double-edged sword in there or at least the two points of the problem. Ever since JetGPT was launched to the web almost two years ago the first thing organizations were concerned about was that their employees would be going on to this commercial tool and dumping sensitive data into it right and that would be equated to a data leak. So we're a couple of years into this and these AI vendors are getting more savvy about how to serve the enterprise and now if you have a conversation with any of them like the Microsoft's the AWS even JetGPT and the enterprise version that I mentioned earlier they'll promise you we won't train your data or we won't train our models on your data right so your data is your data you have your own instance of your model that's data confidentiality is only one of the things that we want to control over as IT administrators right so the other two aspects that we saw in our survey that really mattered when evaluating generative AI solutions are the quality and there's a lot of different performance standards you can consider from you know accuracy to latency and while it seems pretty good that you can ask JetGPT anything and get an answer in a few seconds sometimes a few seconds is just too long for a business process and you need something instantly or you need almost real-time reaction right so that's when you have to look at smaller purpose-built models and maybe put them right on the device and then you have to look at costs that's the other factor that's incredibly important because I think that a lot of people migrated to the cloud maybe didn't refactor their environment as properly as they should have thought that there would be a cost savings and then found out they were shifting their capital cost to operating costs right so they were getting big monthly bills every month so we have to keep in mind that when we're using these cloud-based models we're paying per token for these API exchanges and we have to be aware of how that will scale and how will that will affect the bill at the end of the month. Yeah and I'm gonna tell you somebody's gonna get that 20 billion dollars back or 30 billion dollars or whatever they're putting in or hundreds of billions of dollars they're not going to spend that and invest that not get it back I think we're in for a real cost rise in AI I'm not the only person saying that a lot of people are rumors are saying that open AI will double its cost by the end of the year so having a strategy to look at that or do you have any ideas of what people should be doing based on what we learned about the cloud? Mm-hmm yeah the great thing is that there's a lot of different models that are available and they all have different cost structures first of all you can compare your large language models let's just use open AI's models as an example here if you use chat GPT-4 that's a more expensive model than GPT-4 and that they release differently priced models at different rates because they're aware of this factor so that's just one example where you can say maybe this model is 2% worse than the other model at giving me the answer I want but it's still totally satisfactory for the use case that I'm designing and another way that you might save money is you say you know what I don't want to pay a per transaction every time I'm just going to own the model and host it myself or put it right on the device where it's being used so if the model can be small enough and it's reasonable enough for you to host it sometimes you can host them just fine on a normal desktop computer and the performance is better because it's not in the cloud so that can avoid the costs for transaction as well so there's a number of different strategies you have to take but the real answer is that you have to look at the problem that you're solving first and determine you know what's most important here is it that I spend as little as possible or is this a problem that I'm actually willing to throw money at it because if I solve it it'll be so valuable to my organization despite that I'm still recommending model independence with people and that is that whatever solution you build make sure it's model independent use at least two and and the reason I did that for me was the models get stupid and I don't leave they they change if you watched all of these models they change in how effective they are I can shift between cloud and open AI I'm not there's still some others that I'm I'm still working through Google's notebook LM and their their AI but I've kept at least two or three different models that I can shift between just because and sometimes they just fail so the model independence is one thing I think are you are you seeing people using multiple models definitely I think that that's just the nature of using these LLM said when I talk about the commoditized aspect of it this is one of the things I mean because you can design your application so say that call center application right it's running that script it's hearing the person describe their problem and then it puts it into a prompt to a large language model to get a response the proper response you could have one of several models you could have cloud you could have open AI's GPT model you have one of the Amazon models if you wanted to I think they're available too if you're using something like bedrock to build your application so it's almost interchangeable and you can plug in the model that you need at that moment and if it's not available you can fail over to the next model that does the job just as well right so absolutely multiple models are it's something that anyone that's going past you know the turning on applications that have AI features that they're building their own they're definitely tapping into multiple Nvidia dropped a bomb last week they have their 72 billion parameters it's not the 1.79 trillion parameters of open AI but the early testing is coming back this thing is fantastic in terms of its results it can run on very limited hardware it's open source and they're giving okay they're training metrics the the numbers they use in the training and all of that in as one package it's now open source I think it's gonna drop a bomb in terms of the world that's right now yeah I think open source is big future for these models not only the mega sized models like Nvidia's released but many smaller more purpose-built models that are meant to do one specific job that's really in demand in certain industries let's talk about the security side of this and the dark side of the force here too or the positive depending on you've got these digital humans and deep fakes I mean it's there it really is two sides of the of the coin you've got one hand you've got digital humans the other you've got deep fakes you've got a security issue and you've got a promise of the technology where are you seeing that go well I'm very concerned about the deep fake defense and I think this is a major risk that we'll have to do a lot of work to mitigate and it's sort of a new wrinkle in the cyber security aspect of consideration now organizations spend more on cyber security year in year out feels like it you can't go by a year without 5% 10% increased your cyber security costs that the bad guys are getting more sophisticated and more aggressive year after year with AI powered capabilities we're going to see that reach even higher scales that we have to react to and we have to be ready for now one thing that I noted in the report is that the World Economic Forum ranking what are the greatest threats to the world over the next couple of years and number one wasn't climate change or war which there are multiple wars happening in the world and climate change seems to bring bigger more destructive storms all the time the number one risk was misinformation and disinformation and they said that AI is going to heighten it to all time levels of concern and deep fakes are going to be a big problem and he mentioned open source right and while open source can be great because it can open up innovation for any one that can get their hands on the tool and start editing it that's true for the bad guys too so they have these AI video editors they have these AI image generators and they're removing all the restrictions that these more well-meaning AI vendors put in place and they're going to use those to imitate celebrities imitate politicians imitate your CFO and fool you into wiring a bunch of money over or maybe influencing an election so I think that we're going to be seeing interesting times ahead where we feel like we can't trust our own eyes with what we see on the internet I'm calling it the death of truth I don't think I'm the first person to coin a phrase like that but this is a real situation for everyone and one of concern and I talked about Nvidia dropping this perfect model training data metrics all those things pick it up and run it and but now that's in the hands of everybody there no guardrails no no restrictions on using it what do you know what do you do when you put that in the hands of crooks this idea that even if we take the cybersecurity out of it when we stop being able to count on what is truth the underpinnings of society go away and I don't know how much you've been reading up on this but everybody's trying to figure out a way to label AI generated content and not one company or one person has come up with an idea that's going to work at least so far yeah the problem with watermarking AI content and while I think that this will happen where if you get an image generated out of chat GPT there can be a watermark on there to say that it came from the generator that's a good idea that it's good way easy way to recognize when something's being made by AI the problem is it's so easily removed it only stops the honesty and of course with these open source tools the bad guys will be able to just go in there and remove any watermarking that's built into these models yeah before I let you go I want to talk to you a little bit about quantum because you mentioned that is one of the trends that I don't want to let that go I did an interview I think a few months back with a company in Canada that has a quantum solution so and I was amazed I would not have said this I was amazed to see that they're actually quantum solutions in operation now not the big quantum computers but people are already starting to move towards that yeah to speak to the Canadian example there we can start there a D wave is a Canadian company and in fact they have Canadian customers that are deploying quantum to commercial operations one case study they walked me through recently was with a Pattinson food group which is the groceries chain on the West Coast and they've optimized their delivery routes so every grocery store started delivering groceries during the pandemic and a big problem is how do we get to all these different addresses as efficiently as possible given the track of conditions different all given all the different streets that you can take to get there and quantum computing is perfect for that type of optimization problem so that's one interesting solution that's in the field now it's a hybrid solution quantum computing doesn't do every aspect of the problem but it solves the key part of the key challenge this we're talking about the most leading-edge companies in the world but you look at a company like HSBC a bank in the in the finance sector here and they're experimenting with how to use quantum computer to counter fraud attempts to do better trading optimizations to do better simulation of the market so they can inform their customers better so they see a number of potential advantages the trick though is that you need really rare niche talent I mean how many quantum mathematical PhDs are floating around in the world not too many so the talent is the barrier right now surprisingly access to the hardware is not the barrier a you or I Jim could go and spin up an instance of a cloud computer running on real quantum hardware run IBM's quantum cloud yeah and there's a quantum Institute in Canada it's actually encouraging the use of quantum computers and I've had the head of that that group on our our program as well I don't oversell it either but two things one is it's there it's time to start the education and start learning about it I think for people but the other and it was a realistic thing that you pointed out and I'll put my cybersecurity today hat and that is if you've got all this data and you haven't got it encrypted and it's stolen today it can be used when quantum comes up and can crack your encryption I'm not saying it's for Joe's corner store you know Apple's encryption or you know on your hard drive is just fine I'm happy to just see it encrypted and I'm happy to see with a good password but there are cases where people have highly sensitive data today that they really need to start thinking about that if that's stolen today it could be cracked tomorrow and would that matter this is the problem that you're describing with these harvest now decrypt later and you know there's a day called Q day Q day is someday in the future for quantum computing will be sufficiently powerful to crack RSA encryption which is basically all the encryption we rely upon to do business on the internet the encryption that makes bank transactions possible the encryptions our government's used to make our record secure but so you could imagine if all data was decrypted tomorrow just available for anybody to go and have there'd be a big problem in the world right but now this day Q day unfortunately it's not like Y2K where you can just circle a date on the calendar and know exactly when it's going to happen but it will happen someday in the future whether it's going to be five years from now ten years from now or 15 years from now we can debate that and smarter people than me have definitely done so but the message is that you can migrate your encryption now and you should because of these harvest now decrypt later tax so especially if you're in government in fact if you're a US federal agency by law you have to have a plan on how to migrate your encryption to be post quantum ready less than one year from now yeah there's a lot going on Brian thank you so much for this I before you go what's your what's your final takeaway for people who've heard this and of course how do they get a copy of the report I'm great the easiest way right now we have it front page on infotech.com so if you come there you won't miss it you can download it and I'll look out we're having a webinar later in the month it's open to everybody not just info tech clients so if you haven't registered and you're not able to download it or you don't want to sign up for the account to get a trial and download it that's fine just come to the webinar and we'll tell you what you need to know and of course we've given the overview here as well Jim great great Brian thank you so much this has been fabulous we got to get you on more we love to make this a regular thing hey thanks for having me it's been great to back be back on hashtag trending again yeah the guy who started it I'm sorry I should have celebrated that the first that Brian was the first host of hashtag trending and built it into someday all this will be yours Jim my guest today has been Brian Jackson his research director at infotech don't forget infotech.com you can get a copy of the report and go to his webinar because he's a smart guy and you should go and you'll find it even more than what you heard about on this program thanks Brian for coming by and thank you to our audience for spending part of your weekend with us you can be doing anything else you chose to spend the time with us and that's Thank you very much. That's our show for this week. I'm your host, Jim Love. ",
