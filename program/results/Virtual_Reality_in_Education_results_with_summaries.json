His team has researched game-based language learning in virtual environments.\nOne of the research results they found is that VR can be useful to improve communication skills when learning languages. \u201cWhen you take self-study courses, you rarely get to speak and listen. Oral skills are currently being trained in VR applications,\u201d explains Ahlers.\nExploring a virtual environment or solving tasks provide incentives to converse. Being able to start flexibly without being tied to specific course offerings or times is another advantage of virtual learning worlds.\nMore and more educational content is being conveyed through VR, according to Sabrina Basler from the German Adult Education Association. This includes virtual excursions, city tours or museum visits as well as professional training.\nVR can also help with teaching complex work steps. Train drivers can learn to operate new trains in a virtual environment or medical students can simulate operations before either actually drives a train or operates on a real patient.\n\u201cIn preparation for a real situation, it can be useful to have already mastered a task virtually,\u201d says Ahlers. \u201cI always see a benefit where VR is more effective or cheaper.\u201d\nVirtual excursions instead of real trips\nIn adult education courses, the aim is to use VR to visualise learning objects and make them tangible.\n\u201cFar-away learning or experience spaces can also be made accessible to people who, for social or age reasons, would not have regular access to these experiences, such as virtual excursions as a replacement for real trips,\u201d Basler says.\nVR can also be used in schools: For example, a journey through time to antiquity in history lessons, walking through the human body in biology or an expedition to the Earth's core in geography.\nHowever, this kind of learning \u201cis not suitable for use by students under the age of 13 because their visual development is not yet complete,\u201d Ahlers says.\nThe use of VR in the education sector is still rare, mainly due to high costs. \u201cThe apps are often still demos or smaller, very partial applications. There are hardly any very large learning applications because the development effort is currently still relatively high,\u201d according to the VR expert.\nAdded to this is the cost of the equipment. You can currently get cheap headsets for around \u20ac300/$300, says Ahlers. There are also rental options and headsets without a display into which a smartphone is inserted. These can be had for around \u20ac100/$100 but don\u2019t work so well, Ahlers says.\nFuture is unclear\nSo what is the future of VR in the education sector? \u201cIn terms of breadth, gaming is currently clearly ahead,\u201d says Ahlers.\nDespite the benefits, he does not see VR applications as an alternative to conventional learning methods: \u201cI think the expectation that the virtual world will function as a mirror image of the real world is a little exaggerated.\u201d\nThere is also still scepticism at adult education centres as to whether and to what extent VR will become established on a large scale.\n\u201cIt is unclear as to whether VR can produce a genuine didactic benefit in practise or whether the wow effect of the technology will wear off quickly,\u201d says Basler.\nSolve the daily Crossword\nRecommended articles\n",

His team has researched game-based language learning in virtual environments.\nOne of the research results they found is that VR can be useful to improve communication skills when learning languages. \u201cWhen you take self-study courses, you rarely get to speak and listen. Oral skills are currently being trained in VR applications,\u201d explains Ahlers.\nExploring a virtual environment or solving tasks provide incentives to converse. Being able to start flexibly without being tied to specific course offerings or times is another advantage of virtual learning worlds.\nMore and more educational content is being conveyed through VR, according to Sabrina Basler from the German Adult Education Association. This includes virtual excursions, city tours or museum visits as well as professional training.\nVR can also help with teaching complex work steps. Train drivers can learn to operate new trains in a virtual environment or medical students can simulate operations before either actually drives a train or operates on a real patient.\n\u201cIn preparation for a real situation, it can be useful to have already mastered a task virtually,\u201d says Ahlers. \u201cI always see a benefit where VR is more effective or cheaper.\u201d\nVirtual excursions instead of real trips\nIn adult education courses, the aim is to use VR to visualise learning objects and make them tangible.\n\u201cFar-away learning or experience spaces can also be made accessible to people who, for social or age reasons, would not have regular access to these experiences, such as virtual excursions as a replacement for real trips,\u201d Basler says.\nVR can also be used in schools: For example, a journey through time to antiquity in history lessons, walking through the human body in biology or an expedition to the Earth's core in geography.\nHowever, this kind of learning \u201cis not suitable for use by students under the age of 13 because their visual development is not yet complete,\u201d Ahlers says.\nThe use of VR in the education sector is still rare, mainly due to high costs. \u201cThe apps are often still demos or smaller, very partial applications. There are hardly any very large learning applications because the development effort is currently still relatively high,\u201d according to the VR expert.\nAdded to this is the cost of the equipment. You can currently get cheap headsets for around \u20ac300/$300, says Ahlers. There are also rental options and headsets without a display into which a smartphone is inserted. These can be had for around \u20ac100/$100 but don\u2019t work so well, Ahlers says.\nFuture is unclear\nSo what is the future of VR in the education sector? \u201cIn terms of breadth, gaming is currently clearly ahead,\u201d says Ahlers.\nDespite the benefits, he does not see VR applications as an alternative to conventional learning methods: \u201cI think the expectation that the virtual world will function as a mirror image of the real world is a little exaggerated.\u201d\nThere is also still scepticism at adult education centres as to whether and to what extent VR will become established on a large scale.\n\u201cIt is unclear as to whether VR can produce a genuine didactic benefit in practise or whether the wow effect of the technology will wear off quickly,\u201d says Basler.\nSolve the daily Crossword\nRecommended articles\n",

Whether you're a student, a working professional, or just someone who decided to learn a new skill or language to fill their free time, eLearning has revolutionized the way we learn. For many people, it's not even an alternative; it's the main learning solution. This is because it gives us personalized experiences, engaging content, and flexibility. Most importantly, though, the eLearning trends of 2024 have shown us that, as it evolves, it addresses core issues learners face, like accessibility and adaptability. From giving remote communities access to education to helping busy people gain new skills, these innovations are only making our everyday lives better. Not to mention that eLearning is getting smarter and smarter. One of the biggest eLearning trends in 2024 was the integration of AI and personalization, which create unique experiences for learners, catering to any need they may have.\neLearning is here to stay, and it is regularly enriched with fresh ideas and approaches. This year, the trends and innovations it brought deserve appreciation. Let's dive into the eLearning trends of 2024 that we feel are worthy of gratitude this Thanksgiving.\n6 eLearning Trends In 2024 That We Appreciate\n1. Microlearning\nThe days of long lectures and dull presentations are over, thanks to microlearning . This technology offers short lessons that are focused on specific subjects and fit perfectly into our busy schedules. Why are we thankful? First, it's based on cognitive science. Studies show that we remember more when we learn in short intervals, not only because our attention spans are shrinking but also because it's easier for us to focus without getting overwhelmed by information overload. Not to mention, microlearning is flexible. Even if you only have five minutes, you can do a quick lesson or a pop quiz. It also looks like microlearning isn't going anywhere in the near future; on the contrary, it's going to become the norm, offering small and tailored modules about our jobs, hobbies, and even personal lives.\n2. Personalization Through AI\nAI is taking over almost everything, including eLearning. In particular, it's used for personalizing the learning content. How does it work, though? Instead of being offered a generic lesson plan, with the use of AI tools you can craft a learning journey tailored to your pace, preference, and what you actually need to learn. This is important because the system identifies whether a learner is struggling and offers extra help, such as support, resources, and more time to process the material, or moves on quickly through the modules the learner has mastered. Many educational platforms have leveraged AI, thus creating meaningful lessons that truly resonate with the learners' unique personalities. This alone is enough for us to show appreciation for the beneficial use of AI in education.\n3. Gamification\nOne of the biggest eLearning trends in 2024 was gamification, turning boring learning sessions into little adventures. Gamification includes adding game-like elements, such as rewards, challenges, and leaderboards, to educational content to make it fun. This approach deserves appreciation this year because it became really popular. It also adapted to all audiences, from corporate training programs to K-12 online classrooms . For example, companies use it to make onboarding exciting, while teachers leverage it to make students enjoy math through quests and challenges. The results? Gamification keeps people engaged, boosting motivation and long-term knowledge retention. And it fits all niches. Whether someone wants to learn a language or train employees on compliance, they can turn modules into fun experiences.\n4. VR And AR\nSpeaking of fun lessons, we couldn't forget about Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR). These technologies have made their way into the classroom, creating hands-on, immersive learning experiences. VR and AR in eLearning offer learning opportunities that many people would never imagine they could have. For instance, with VR, it's possible to practice heart surgery or even walk around the markets of Ancient Greece. Wearing the right equipment, you enter a safe virtual environment where you can test different subjects and experience concepts in an immersive way without real-world consequences. The same applies to AR. Wearing AR glasses, you can display information or virtual elements right into the real world and experience the learning material firsthand.\n5. Accessibility Innovations\neLearning in 2024 has seen a major advancement in tools and platforms designed to eliminate barriers for learners with disabilities. But first, let's introduce the features and equipment that make lessons accessible: screen readers, closed captions, and text-to-speech features. These ensure that content is accessible to learners no matter their abilities. Then there's also multilingual support . Platforms now cater to learners in different languages, allowing people from every corner of the world to get an equal chance at education. We are thankful for these accessibility innovations because they empower people. Underrepresented groups now have access to resources they were often excluded from, whether it's a student taking an online course or a professional growing their career.\n6. Social Learning Platforms\neLearning can sometimes be a solitary experience. Enter social learning platforms, which, in 2024, were leveraged to bring learners together, turning remote learning into a collaborative experience. Social learning platforms allow people to share ideas, ask questions, and help each other out. They include interactive discussion boards, group projects, and live collaboration tools that create the sense of being in a classroom. Social learning also enhances soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem solving, thanks to all the idea-sharing and discussions. Besides, information sticks better this way.\nConclusion\nThe future of eLearning looks promising, with all the technology advancing fast. This creates the perfect setting for more personalized, immersive, and inclusive learning experiences. If we consider that AI tools already predict our learning needs before we even realize them, virtual classrooms feel as real as in-person ones, and platforms connect learners across the globe, we can only be thankful. However, we are also grateful for the developers, educators, and innovators who strive to transform education, and everyone who believes in making it more impactful, accessible, and exciting for everyone.\nRead Also\nResources\nMore eLi\nBecome a contributor\nAdvertise with us\n\u00a9 2011 - 2024 eLearning Industry\n",

He noted that the experience uses a storytelling technique distinct from conventional methods.\nStating that he had been living in T\u00fcrkiye for a long time, Rehman said: \"I thought my experience in Paris should be shared with the world, and I chose T\u00fcrkiye as the starting point. We have been producing various VR content across different cities in T\u00fcrkiye for over three years. During this process, I realized how inclined and curious the Turkish people are toward\u00a0such technologies. This realization led to the decision to open the museum here. Over the past two years, my partner Virgile and I have worked tirelessly to make this museum a reality in T\u00fcrkiye. Through M\u00fczeverse, we aimed to create a form where visitors could feel immersed and experience the theme being told. We believe we succeeded in doing so.\"\nRehman stated that when explaining their intended VR model, those who hadn't experienced it struggled to visualize it. He said, \"Initially, we encountered reactions like 'How would this work?' or 'Is it really worth it?' However, those who experienced it expressed that they encountered something far beyond their expectations. This shows we are on the right track. We chose the pyramids for this experience because the era of Ancient Egypt has universal meaning for everyone. Moreover, the structures of Ancient Egypt offer unique and fascinating stories about the technological advancements of their time. We will continue our virtual journeys with different content.\"\nWorking with a massive team\nVR Future Co-Founder Virgile Mangiavillano emphasized that M\u00fczeverse represents a new generation of art, inviting visitors to \"experience the future of entertainment.\"\nMangiavillano noted that the museum can host up to 100 people simultaneously, saying, \"We prepared an environment where friends can share similar feelings together. Art enthusiasts will enjoy a social experience while walking for approximately 45 minutes. The best way to describe the museum is as a 'virtual reality' discovery. We are thrilled to open this museum in T\u00fcrkiye in collaboration with Excurio, a VR company that has won awards in seven different countries.\"\nHighlighting that one of M\u00fczeverse's primary goals is education, Mangiavillano said: \"Through this VR model, we aim to raise awareness among young people about both technology and new art forms. To convey this, we chose the slogan 'a journey through time.' Most people who experienced it say they played virtual games before but never encountered anything like this. We worked with a massive team, from screenwriters to designers, and this is why we consider the museum to be a 'new generation art form.'\"\n\nJapan firm \u2018doesn't have money for slavery compensation\u2019\nJapan firm \u2018doesn't have money for slavery compensation\u2019\nStaff at luxury store Harrods to strike ahead of busy Christmas\nMinistry reveals stray dog law principles\nHezbollah chief says lost Syria 'military supply route' with Assad's fall\nA week after Assad's fall, Syrians step toward normalcy amid uncertainty\nAdventurers climb Mount Erciyes to see temple\nSelena Gomez announces engagement to Benny Blanco\nScientists extract cancer-fighting particles from rare earth minerals\nHistoric letter chronicles sinking of Ottoman battleship during Gallipoli campaign\nA Far Easterner with three tables in Tarlaba\u015f\u0131\nFire of Anatolia to dazzle Germany in European tour\nMiss Netherlands pageant scrapped after 35 years\nHezbollah chief says lost Syria 'military supply route' with Assad's fall\nThe head of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah has admitted his group can no longer be supplied militarily through Syria after rebels toppled Hezbollah ally Bashar al-Assad.\nJapan firm \u2018doesn't have money for slavery compensation\u2019\nA Japanese textile company, ordered by Ecuadorian courts to pay $41 million to compensate its workers for keeping them in slave-like conditions, has claimed\u00a0it lacks the money to pay up.\nFenerbah\u00e7e in tatters after Athletic loss\nFenerbah\u00e7e headed into turbulent times after a home loss in the Europa League against Athletic Bilbao on Dec. 11 night added to the club\u2019s wounds and sparked fan protests.\n",

One of the aspects of using the technology for our students is that it is something that's fairly new and fairly innovative for them to use, but it's a technology that\u2019s starting to be used clinically,\u201d Walters said.\nAccording to Walters, in clinical practice, speech pathologists are now looking to see how the technology might be used, leading the university to provide \u201csome exposure to virtual reality and what it could do\u201d.\nIt also offers student practice in interacting with young kids as some reported feeling \u201cworried about working with children\u201d.\n\u201cThe students put the headsets on and they're in that immersive experience where they're in a clinic room, there's a child in front of them and there's two different children that they can choose from.\n\u201cThere's a four-year-old and a six-year-old. They choose the child that they want to work with. They're immersed in this oral musculature assessment, so they're going through the procedure.\u201d\nWalters said work began around 2020 with roughly 25 students, with surveys showing participants found the technology engaging.\n\u201cInitially our students went, \u2018This is cool.\u2019 They were very taken with the technology. That was a good outcome to start with, even if it wasn't any different than the way we were teaching it before, they were really engaged.\n\u201cThen when they went through the procedure and \u2026 they started to go, 'Wow, this is great because I can almost control my own learning'.\u201d\nWith students enjoying the VR studies, Walters said next steps include building out learning modules. \u201cWe're in the process of developing a second module and so the first module was the students' learning the procedure of an oral musculature assessment.\n\u201cThis second module is exciting; is it's looking at the different variations in anatomy that a speech pathology student might see when they look in a child's mouth.\n\u201cWe have got some children with different variations. One of the children has got a tongue tie, so they can't protrude their tongue beyond their lip. Another child has a high palate and when you look in their mouth behind their teeth, it's quite high and vaulted, and another child has enlarged tonsils.\u201d\nShe pointed to the importance of industry partnerships when creating content for university students.\n\u201cWhat we're looking at is that it is important to look at different ways of teaching our students.\n\u201cI think we're starting to see students coming into tertiary education looking very different than they did, say, 15 years ago when I was first teaching.\n\u201cI feel that our students are wanting more from that learning environment and looking at different ways to learn.\n\u201cBeing able to explore other ways of teaching and student learning has been really useful. As an end user of virtual reality, certainly think it is something that we should be continuing to do.\n\u201cCertainly, that partnership with industry from a university perspective has been really useful,\u201d Walters said.\nYou just read a Digital Nation story.\nThere are many others like it.
