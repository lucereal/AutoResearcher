And to kick off this season, two of the most athletic but not good passers were added to the statistical mix (AR and Daniels\u2026and he\u2019ll, so far Caleb as well). Couple that with the return of guys like fields and Watson not being able to complete a pass, and things are off to a rocky start.\nI\u2019d be curious to see what the rb stats are on a comparative basis over the years without the QBs mucking up the data.\nTrue, and its also only two weeks of stats, so it'll be interesting to see how things play out. Totalyards in general are trending down which, regardless of QB runs, isn't enough to make up for the lack of passing yards. All of the injuries at WR certainly won't help either.\nIf you actually look at the starting QB for each team this year, the lower passing stats make perfect sense. I expect this trend to continue for a while, but maybe the run rate will go down as some of the younger QBs get more acclimated and the more established QBs get in a rhythm.\nWe have the rookie QBs:\nBo Nix\nCaleb Williams\nJayden Daniels\nYear 2 QBs who didn't start all of last season, so they're almost rookies:\nAnthony Richardson\nWill Levis\n\"Established\" Year 2 QBs:\nBryce Young (not for long)\nJordan Love (who played one game this year, and his backup in week 2 is not a normal starting caliber QB)\nCJ Stroud (although he is only increasing passing stats for the league)\nAnd the \"transition\" QBs (not the expected future of the franchise, but they have to start someone):\nJacoby Brissett (Maye)\nJustin Fields (Russell Wilson preferred starter)\nSam Darnold (what will happen with McCarthy if Darnold continues to be good?)\nGardner Minshew (what is the plan?)\nThe thing that may normalize a bit are the more established QBs who haven't put up great numbers so far:\nJoe Burrow\nJared Goff\nDak Prescott\nJustin Herbert (seems like an offensive game plan switch)\nKirk Cousins (yeah?)\nAaron Rodgers\nTrevor Lawrence (jury is still out...)\nMatt Stafford (team is decimated, so probably not going to change soon)\nDaniel Jones (hahaha)\nDon't we generally have that same situation every year though?  3 rookie starting QBs doesn't seem outside the norm for the last decade.\nHere is the complete dataset in a gdoc so you guys can take a closer look.\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\nMore posts you may like\nThe place to discuss all NFL related things\nWho are the NFL's best edge rushers?

              "text_data": "TOUT WARS!\nFantasy Baseball's Battle of the Experts\nTout Table: Off Season Prep\nIn the final installment of the 2024 season, the Touts were asked: What is your plan for offseason prep? Are you considering doing any differently than past years?\nJeff Boggis (Fantasy Football Empire, @JeffBoggis): Looking at my numerous leagues that I\u2019ve played in this season, I want to evaluate my draft results versus how well each player did at that draft round. Some leagues were better than others, so I want to conduct an internal retrospective of what went well and want needs improvement. This pertains to drafts, in-season management, and trades. I also want to conduct a deeper dive to see where my overall strengths and weaknesses are by each category. Finally, I want to review risk/reward picks and start preparing for 2025 with potential breakouts and prospects.\nRay Murphy (BaseballHQ, @RayHQ): Writing the 2025 Baseball Forecaster and putting together First Pitch Arizona will have me chomping at the bit to get in a draft room right after Thanksgiving!\nRon Shandler (RonShandler.com, @RonShandler): What Ray said.\nChris Blessing (BaseballHQ, @C_Blessing): I\u2019m not the type to do a post-mortem until after New Years, getting as far away from the season as I possibly can, mostly because of my various assignments from now until then. This year, I felt behind the eight ball a bit with my in-season moves, especially in my dynasty leagues where I didn\u2019t have the same success in FAAB and on the wire as I have in the past. I try not to analyze my player preferences most off-seasons. However, this year, I will delve into my player preferences much deeper than ever before.\nChris Clegg (Pitcher List, @RotoClegg): I have already started taking in what went right and wrong in each league and how I can improve on the things that did not go well. I think its always important to evaluate process, player evals, etc. to really see where you can improve. The start of my offseason involves writing prospect evaluations and top 30s for each team. After that it will be doing player evaluations on the major league side. From there my draft prep will really begin.\nSeth Trachtman (SethRoto.com, Yardbarker, @sethroto): My offseason plan is generally the same each year: Evaluate farm systems in October, evaluate each MLB player in November/December, and finalize v1 of projections/rankings by Christmas. The rest of the offseason until Opening Day is a constant adjustment based on player news, league news, and ADP.\nHoward Bender (Fantasy Alarm, @RotoBuzzGuy): My offseason prep will remain exactly the same. I don\u2019t see a reason to change my process for that. My in-season work? Well, that requires me budgeting more time for MLB and less for the mouth-breathing knuckle draggers of fantasy football. Sorry for my in-season neglect, Touts. I\u2019ll be better next year!\nDan Strafford (MoonshotsMLB, @DanStrafford): My offseason plan? To quote Homer Simpson \u201cI\u2019m gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night!\u201d Sincerely though, every year I think I\u2019ll look back at the drafts I did previously and assess what I did as best as I can. This year, I\u2019m not even going to pretend that to be a possibility. Instead, I am going to take some time to check in on projections vs end of season results for any potential bounce back candidates or overachievers to flag for potentially early best ball drafting. From there, I\u2019ll start tracking the work of some of the smart folks I follow to see where there first inclination on 2025 is.\nRob Leibowitz (Rotoheaven, @rob_leibowitz): Step 1: Repeat the mantra \u201cI will not price enforce Esteury Ruiz\u201d into a state of unconsciousness. Step 2: Systematically analyze depth charts evaluating players, playing time, and prospects. The earlier I begin, the quicker I finish, the more time I can spend adjusting and strategy prepping.\nDoug Dennis (BaseballHQ, @dougdennis41): I need to be more careful about players who have shown a propensity to miss games for injury during the season. I need to re-think OBP and BA after the first half of this season. I need to consider how to change up my strategy in a couple of leagues where the league has figured out how to adjust to the prices/talent pool. I need to be more long-term going into my dynasty league. I need to think differently about the middle rounds of my draft/hold. I need to consider my own biases\u2013particularly with pitching. (Why does all this make me feel like Bart Simpson writing sentences on the blackboard?) Otherwise, 90% of the work is identical year over year.\nPatrick Davitt (BaseballHQ, @patrickdavitt): FPAZ prep from now till Oct 31, then no baseball until after Christmas. When I do start, I\u2019ll have a reading regimen, and I want to go through the player value list to get an early start on what might be mis-valuations. I\u2019ll also be noodling around with hitter-pitcher budget splits and auction-dollar allocations, hoping to develop some useful way of doing likewise for snake drafts.\nD.J. Short (NBC Sports, @djshort): I\u2019m usually competitive in Tout Wars most years, but pitching is one area (especially in regard to starters) where a little extra research and preparation could finally get me over the top. So, part of my prep this offseason will be looking at winners from this year and previous years to see their roadmap to success and see if I can glean anything from it. Granted, this was a weird year for SPs, but trying to draw conclusions from some of the brightest minds in the industry is never a bad idea.\nRay Flowers (Fantasy Guru, @TheRayFlowers): I think more of the same. I always look inward first to see what I can improve with my analysis. I will be looking more into head-to-head as the feedback I get from folks is that they are tilting away from roto, to my dismay. I try to take October off to focus fully on football, but I usually fail and start looking ahead to the coming year of baseball before Halloween.\nDr. Roto (DrRoto.com, @DrRoto): I turn my complete attention to football at least through the end of the year. Then I love to do a draft champions league which helps me know the player pool much better. Drafting 50 rounds makes for lots of catching up in short order!\nCarlos Marcano (Triple Play Fantasy, @camarcano): I\u2019m already looking at pitchers because I\u2019m obsessed about them, like, unhealthily obsessed, to be honest. And I believe that\u2019s the reason I tend to underperform with hitting so I will need to come up with a better plan to balance my attention and valuations towards hitting.\nMike Podhorzer (Fangraphs, @MikePodhorzer): Several years ago, I paused projecting player performance, as it became too time consuming and led to burn out. I have no plans to revisit those manual forecasts, so the offseason is finally a chance to relax and enjoy stressless days, no longer ruined by bullpens blowing my starting pitchers\u2019 wins! I still follow player movement, but don\u2019t truly get back into the swing of things until Spring Training begins.\nVlad Sedler (FTN Fantasy, @rotogut): First, a two-week siesta. When I awaken, I will comb through the copious amount of data I\u2019ve collected from this season, run the accuracy of our 2024 projections, and begin the process of 2025 projections. I\u2019ll also revisit notes I\u2019ve made to myself throughout the season. Documentation in-season is key since there is so much we forget. It\u2019s something new I\u2019ve integrated into my process this year.\nErik Halterman (Rotowire, @erik_halterman): I\u2019m going to add more columns to my rankings spreadsheet. Will that lead to more accurate rankings? No idea. Will it lead to a more cumbersome spreadsheet? Definitely.\nGarion Thorne (DraftKings, @GarionThorne): As much as I\u2019d like my offseason prep to begin as soon as the last out of the World Series happens, I have professional commitments to fantasy football and fantasy basketball that take up a lot of my Fall and Winter. I tend to think that a little time away from baseball helps refresh and reset. It can even help cleanse you of carrying over unnecessary ideologies from last season. That being said, I\u2019ll be on FanGraphs and Baseball Savant as soon as that first free agent signs. Sweet, sweet addiction.\nFrank Ammirante (The GameDayHQ, @FAmmiranteTFJ): I\u2019m planning to start offseason prep much earlier. Usually, I wait until January because I\u2019m heavily involved in football, but that won\u2019t be the case this year. I had a pretty good season, but it could have been much better. Looking to dive in on each player as soon as the season ends.\nPhil Hertz (Baseball HQ, @prhz50): Not going to change much, if at all. For the first couple of months, I\u2019ll try to enjoy the postseason and follow player movement news. Sometime in mid-December , I\u2019ll start organizing my players into tiers. In January and February, I\u2019ll refine those lists and eventually try to \u201cpick\u201d my team.\nRick Wolf (SiriusXM Fantasy, @RickWolf1): This time of year, I promise myself that I will go to First Pitch Arizona to make sure I have to stay with baseball. When I was doing the radio show for the last 12 years, I was all football \u2013 all the time. Now, I can stay close to the September call ups and plan to spend MUCH more of the fall with baseball reading and watching at bats for pitching and hitting. Need to also understand better how to identify the rookies and breakout candidates. It is on the fringes that championships are won. Our core system is strong but we have been missing on the prospects and breakouts badly lately. Looks like another 2nd place finish this year. If you\u2019re not first\u2026\nMatt Cederholm (Baseball HQ, @TheBigHurtHQ): First Pitch Arizona! Draft prep starts NOW. Admittedly, after the Baseball Forecaster whirlwind and FPAZ, I\u2019ll wait until after the holidays. As I usually do, I\u2019ll do a \u201cwhat went right/what went wrong\u201d assessment. This year, I\u2019ll be focusing on why I consistently struggled to find starting pitching in almost every league. Maybe it was a fantasy-wide trend, but I think I went beyond that trend. I\u2019m usually very good at identifying emerging pitchers, so maybe overconfidence?\nAndy Andres (BaseballHQ, @sabermetrics101): Trying to figure out the right way to take advantage of the bat swing data for evaluations and projections \u2014 just used the tip of the iceberg this year. I also want to reflect on the right weight to put on pitching at the draft/auction \u2014 my thinking about this is all over the place.\nCorbin Young (Baseball HQ, Rotowire, @corbin_young21): In the heart of football season, it will be minimal baseball prep beyond contributing to the Baseball Forecaster and maybe an occasional leaderboard/filter data pull. Once football season is over, then I do some deeper dives based on the filters and data I look at to see what\u2019s going on. And of course, use some projections to see which players stand out based on the early draft market because there are a ton of sickos drafting during football season (only kidding).\nJason Collette (Rotowire, @): The exact opposite of what I did this past offseason. I did far better with individual player work than I did with team construction work and had another disappointing Tout finish despite a better year in LABR. I\u2019m frustrated with my lack of success in recent seasons in this league and need to figure out how I continue to screw things up.\nAlan Harrison (The Fantasy Fix, @TheFantasyFix): Preparation for the upcoming season typically starts in mid-November. Most of the process will remain the same: building out my spreadsheets, sorting out position eligibility, identifying timetables for injured players to return/when players will be promoted to the league and developing tiers/ranks.\nAnthony Perri (Fantistics, @Anthony_Perri): One of the first things I do is look back and see if any new trends have emerged. How accurate were my projection models on a global scale, how accurate were they by position, by player? What indicators did I rely too heavily on or fade, and was there relevance? Are there new indicators that can be deployed moving forward.\nJeff Zimmerman (Fangraphs, @jeffwzimmerman): It\u2019s tough to do anything new with so much on the table. One item I want to accomplish is to automate more items especially if I use the process in season. Shaving a few minutes here and there will help a ton.\nAndy Behrens (Yahoo Fantasy Sports, @andybehrens): I will be meeting with the members of my Research Department individually and firing everyone who was tasked with forecasting pitchers. Also, I\u2019m firing anyone who said Ohtani would just clog my Utility spot.\nDerek VanRiper (The Athletic, @DerekVanRiper): I will take a longer break between the seasons. Playoff pods will fill up the calendar in October until First Pitch Arizona, so I won\u2019t spend much time thinking about the 2024 regular season until the conference gets underway.\nTodd Zola (Mastersball, @toddzola): I know my drafting needs improvement, but my in-season management requires more. Both Rotowire and the NFBC platform offer fabulous tools to facilitate weekly roster maintenance, but I need to design something more tailored to my personal weaknesses. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll make it commercially available as that depends on the ease of automation. As for drafting, I am wholly embarrassed by my public facing teams (TGFBI, Tout, NERF, Beat TZ RW OLC), but I am having a solid season in a few private leagues, so it\u2019s not like I completely forgot how to draft, so I will dig in to try to develop more consistency. My offseason schedule will afford me more of an opportunity to achieve this than past years. Why? Because I am leading the relaunch of Fantasy Index baseball magazine, so the deadline for profiles is MUCH earlier. Up until this year, I always was knocking off some stragglers in January and February, but 500-plus profiles will be in the hopper by December 15.\nMichael A. Stein (Fantasy Judgment, @FantasyJudgment): I need to focus on accumulation of quality depth with pitching because I have been burned severely the past few years in Roto leagues. Rather than targeting a couple ace starters in the first few rounds, I want to be more flexible and creative in drafts by considering taking the best hitters available and focus on building pitching staffs later on. I plan on doing more mock drafts with different rules, formats and number of teams so I can test out some theories and scenarios. For my H2H points leagues, I will make my spreadsheets with 2024 stats and 2025 projections and set my tiers at each position. I probably won\u2019t start doing this until after Thanksgiving, but if there is a flurry of early off-season free agent/trade action then I may be more inclined to start prepping earlier.\nShelly Verougstraete (Fantasy Feud Podcast, @ShellyV_643): I plan to take time off and enjoy playoff baseball! This was my worst season to date, so after the World Series, I plan on doing a deep dive to see if there were any trends or just \u2018one of those years\u2019.\nSteve Gardner (USA TODAY Sports, @SteveAGardner): Nothing too different for me. Some possible postseason \u201creal\u201d baseball coverage could be in the works. Happily continuing my annual trek to the Arizona Fall League and First Pitch Arizona. Wish I had more fantasy baseball \u201cwork\u201d to do, but otherwise I\u2019ll try to get started on 2025 rankings.\nJames Anderson (Rotowire, @RealJRAnderson): The one thing I know I want to re-dedicate myself to is digging deep(er) on the mid-to-late round SPs. I did NFBC Gladiator drafts in fall of 2022 but didn\u2019t do them in fall of 2023. I might get back to doing those this fall since it\u2019s good practice for the 12-team formats that I struggled with this year. I think I\u2019m also going to spread my draft champions leagues out better this offseason. I did a bunch of early DCs last year and fewer late ones, but I think the quality of the owners is better in the early ones, so I could do better (and be better prepared) if I did fewer super early drafts.\nLarry Schechter (Winning Fantasy Baseball, @LarrySchechter): Last year I needed to streamline my process because I was crazy busy finishing my new book and this year I will be crazy busy promoting it so I am going to have to use the same streamlined process\u2026hopefully with better results\u2026because this year sucked.\nSky Dombroske (Fantistics Insider Baseball, @SkyDombroske): I\u2019m less burned-out on baseball this year than I have been the past few, but I\u2019ll likely still take a few weeks to decompress and enjoy the playoffs. After that, I really need to take a look at my traditional roto strategy. I was pretty unsuccessful in that format this year (1 1st, 1 3rd, 3 OOM), while in any other format I had a very solid year. It\u2019s pretty common knowledge that I don\u2019t prefer the format, but is that the reason for the lackluster performance?\nScott Swanay (FantasyBaseballSherpa, @fantasy_sherpa): I noticed some strange relationships between 2023 auction prices and final stats, both for Hitters & for Pitchers; I\u2019ll be curious to look at the final 2024 stats and see if those relationships held true this year as well or not.\nDave Adler (Baseball HQ, @daveadler01): I\u2019ll start by analyzing 2024 player stats to see if their performance was more fact than fluke; the goal is to identify under- or over-performers and adjust the 2025 outlooks accordingly. I\u2019ll then track off-season transactions and determine the effect on 2025 playing time. now that I\u2019ve played in the league for a year, I\u2019ll figure out how I want to change my strategy for next year.\nRyan Bloomfield (BaseballHQ, @RyanBHQ): Break? What break!? Diving straight into writing/editing work for the 2025 Baseball Forecaster and continuing twice-weekly episodes of our Bubba and the Bloom podcast. Check us out!\nRick Graham (Pitcher List, @IAmRickGraham): I\u2019ll take a week or two to enjoy the postseason before starting to look into 2025. I\u2019ll be working on early closer/reliever rankings in October and look forward to attending FPAZ at the end of the month. One thing I plan on focusing on this offseason is looking at draft/auction strategy trends, as I feel like the shift towards spending heavy draft capital on hitting over pitching seemed to pay off this year. Was this season just different or is this here to stay?\nRyan Hallam (Fighting Chance Fantasy, @FightingChance): As someone who is also an analyst of sorts for football, I don\u2019t normally take time to go over what I did right and wrong in baseball each season, but I definitely want to grade myself this season as it did not go my way. Injuries were definitely a factor, but everyone had that, so it is hard to make that a crutch. I also want to take a look at trends over the last two months of the season to see who I think can take that momentum into a much better 2025.\nPeter Kreutzer (Rotoman.substack.com, @kroyte): I\u2019m going to do pretty much the same: Write 1,000 or so profiles for Rotoman\u2019s Fantasy Baseball Guide 2025 A-Z with prices and projections and update them all spring for the rotoman.substack.com newsletter. The goal is to know the player pool and identify players with potential who are being overlooked. I\u2019ve got to get on it, the XFL draft is a month away.\nNick Pollack (Pitcher List, @PitcherList): I sprint through the finish line and publish a way-too-early Top 200 SP days after the season ends to ensure all my current interpretations of the season are on paper, while setting a baseline to update in February and March. The next four months involve livestreams of each team\u2019s expected rotation, ensuring I\u2019ve updated my baseline expectations for them entering 2025. If you want Abs in the summer, you have build them in the winter!\nCJ Kaltenbach (Fantasy Guru, @TheSeigeDFS): Focus more on the elite bats, the gap between the elite bats and the replacement level has gotten higher than ever so missing on early hitting can doom your season the way it hasn\u2019t in the past so I\u2019ll be spending more time at the top of the draft than I have in past off seasons. Other than that will do NFBC Cutlines to hone in on the player pool for next spring.\nZach Steinhorn (Steinhorn\u2019s Universe on Substack, @zachsteinhorn): I don\u2019t plan on changing much. Aside from participating in mock drafts for publications, I like to take a break from fantasy baseball thinking until after the new year. I\u2019ll then read as many articles and listen to as many podcasts as I can with the goal of formulating my own lists of overrated and underrated players, also known as early-round avoids and late-round targets. I didn\u2019t hit on as many late-round starting pitchers this year as in years past, so I\u2019ll try to figure out what went wrong in that department.\nBrendan Tuma (Underdog Fantasy, @toomuchtuma): This offseason, I\u2019m interested in taking a deeper look at MLB as a whole. This includes 2024 as well as previous seasons to get an understanding of where the game is trending, and how we can use that to our advantage for fantasy purposes. League-wide stats I want to dive into include ERA, BABIP, homer-to-fly ball rate, etc. The Juiced Ball Era is over. Sticky stuff is gone. Stolen bases are up. Now that the dust is settling on a flurry of changes from the past 4-5 years, which positions and stats should we consider scarce? Which are readily available throughout the year? This will help shape an optimal approach heading into 2025.\nGrey Albright (RazzBall, @razzball): I will watch postseason baseball and bask in the glory of my league winnings and pretend the leagues I lost never happened, then I\u2019m going to Paris in November, while there I will tell them \u201cje suis Raygun\u201d and break dance. When I return, I will begin my 2025 rankings.\nMichael Govier (Pallazzo Podcast, @mjgovier): Sigh\u2026I have to reduce the amount & the variety of different league formats I am in. It\u2019s just not working. Two straight years of ho-hum results has made that clear. 2022 was a great year with solid returns both financially & as far as placing in multiple leagues. I have too many dynasty leagues that I need to purge. I also want to focus much more on best ball leagues next year instead. I put in the time during the offseason last year, but I am going to start even sooner this time with more focus on pitching because I am falling short in K\u2019s too often across the last two years. All I know is what I\u2019ve been doing the last two years isn\u2019t working, but most of all I want to be in-person for my Tout Wars draft in 2025. That\u2019s my number one goal of the offseason because I love being in Tout! I am grateful for the opportunity & next year is my year!\nRudy Gamble (Razzball, @RudyGamble): Last year, I tried something new and put out a Beta version of the Steamer/Razzball projections in Oct/Nov. I did not think it was very productive and will likely go back to my standard practice of taking Oct-Dec off from MLB and spend Jan-Mar building and iterating on the Steamer/Razzball preseason projections where I focus mainly on player roles and playing time (AB/IP). I\u2019ll also analyze 2024 projections vs actuals to see if there are any notable areas to try and improve upon.\nJoe Orrico (Fantasy Pros, @JoeOrrico99): I plan to take the month of October (mostly) off from producing content, just to give the batteries a chance to recharge. Once the cold days start to come in November, I start to break down every team, player, position, and stat category to try and see if there are any trends or patterns I should be aware of. Then, I\u2019ll start my initial rankings process, entering into some early drafts to battle test my initial gut feelings. Before we know it, it\u2019ll be pitchers and catchers time\nGreg Jewett (The Athletic, @gjewett9): Very different. I had a tremendous year in 2023 and rested on my laurels. I will get back to my roots and dive deeper into my off-season process of assessing players for the upcoming season. My closer work has increased, but it\u2019s also prepared me for content this winter. I thank Tout for the opportunity to play in the H2H league for the past four years.\nJoe Gallina (Fantasy Alarm, @joegallina): I\u2019m hoping to be able to recharge my batteries, watch some Yankees playoff baseball, and I also plan on spending part of the offseason taking a deeper dive into learning more about the nuances of using Statcast in my baseball prep and content creation.\nBret Sayre (Baseball Prospectus, @BretSayreBP): Generally, I just enjoy watching the playoffs in October, level set my dynasty rankings/teams in November and then try not to think about it at all in December (to varying degrees of success). I don\u2019t plan on doing anything differently this offseason in terms of that process, but I definitely feel like i had more success from a strategic standpoint on the hitting side than the pitching side in 2024, so I\u2019ll likely dive into that a little more specifically come January.\nJustin Mason (Friends With Fantasy Benefits, @JustinMasonFWFB): I always begin my prep for an upcoming season by looking backwards first. By examining the previous season, I am able to see why I did well or I didn\u2019t do well to make sure if I have any gaps in my approach, I can fix that for the upcoming season.\nShare this:\nLeave a Reply\nYour email address will not be published.

As we enter the heart of the fantasy football season, target trends become even clearer. We also become inundated with bye weeks and injuries, which makes it important to track not only raw targets but targets/game and team target share when examining how players are utilized in the passing game. As usual, let\u2019s start this article by looking at the overall target leaders so far this season.\nTarget Trends\nThis week, we have a new overall target leader as Garrett Wilson \u2019s massive 22 target day brings him up to 56 on the season. Malik Nabers falls to second with 52. Despite missing the game with a concussion, Nabers is the only receiver other than Wilson with at least 50 targets on the season. Amari Cooper and Wan\u2019Dale Robinson are tied in third place with 47 targets apiece .\nRookie Brock Bowers leads all tight ends with 36 targets on the season and is currently the TE1 in fantasy football. Colby Parkinson is second at the position with 32 targets, followed by Jake Ferguson and Trey McBride at 30. Ferguson and McBride have each missed a game and are averaging more targets/game (7.5) than Bowers (7.2)\nAt running back, Breece Hall and Alvin Kamara lead the way with 28 targets each. That puts them on pace for 95 targets on the season, which is the total Hall hit to lead the position last season. De\u2019Von Achane and Jerome Ford are tied for third with 23 targets.\nI\u2019ll continue to lead off this article with season-long target leaders each week but for now, let\u2019s check out the weekly target trends heading into Week 6.\nGarrett Wilson \u2013 22 targets, 13 rec\nWilson\u2019s target total isn\u2019t just a career-high, it\u2019s the most that any player has seen in a game since 2015 when Antonio Brown and DeAndre Hopkins each hit that mark. It\u2019s a number that only 12 players have reached since the NFL began tracking targets in 1992. Wilson\u2019s team target share climbed nearly five percentage points up to 30.4% on the season.\nDarnell Mooney \u2013 16 targets, 9 rec Drake London \u2013 13 targets, 12 rec\nMooney saw 16 targets twice in his time with the Bears but that was back during the 2021 season. It\u2019s easy to forget that he was targeted 140 times that year, by far the most of his career. As for London, he has impressively seen his targets increase in each of the five games played this season. The pure volume won\u2019t be there every week, as Kirk Cousins attempted a career-high 58 passes in Week 5, but it\u2019s positive to see both wideouts being involved.\nTee Higgins \u2013 14 targets, 9 rec Ja\u2019Marr Chase \u2013 12 targets, 10 rec\nWe saw the high-powered offense we expected from the Bengals in Week 5. Higgins started the season slowly as he worked through his hamstring injury but has now seen double-digit targets in consecutive games. He\u2019s seen 14+ targets twice earlier in his career but not since 2021. He has a 28% target share in his three games played, outpacing Chase (23%) over that span. Chase also saw double-digit targets for the first time this season. He was the number one WR on the week and the performance was enough to elevate him to the WR1 on the season.\nJustin Jefferson \u2013 14 targets, 6 rec\nJefferson is yet another receiver who finally saw double-digit targets for the first time of the season in Week 5. Unfortunately, he failed to find the end zone for the first time all season, resulting in his lowest fantasy output of the year. He has a 33.9% target share, the highest of any player who has played in five games. His 43 total targets easily lead the Vikings, with Aaron Jones coming in next with 20.\nLos Angeles Rams Pass Catchers\nTight end Colby Parkinson led the Rams with a career-high 13 targets in Week 5. He\u2019s up to 32 targets on the season, already just two shy of the career-best 34 from his previous two seasons with Seattle. Rookie Jordan Whittington wasn\u2019t targeted in Week 1 but has seen his targets increase in five consecutive games. The same can be said for veteran Tutu Atwell . The target share for the Rams will continue to be dynamic, as Cooper Kupp is targeting a return after their Week 6 bye and Puka Nacua should be back at some point later in the season.\nZay Flowers \u2013 12 targets, 7 rec\nIt\u2019s been a roller coaster ride for Flowers through five weeks. He saw 21 targets over the first two weeks of the season, two games that Baltimore lost. The Ravens then won the next two games in blowout fashion and Flowers was barely used, seeing just six targets over that span. He was back to double-digit targets in the shootout win over Cincinnati in Week 5. He takes on Washington in Week 6 in a game with a juicy 52.5 point over/under.\nIndianapolis Colts Pass Catchers\nMichael Pittman Jr . leads the Colts with 37 targets this season but Josh Downs has been closing the gap. The target count has been 21-17 in favor of Downs over the last two games with Joe Flacco in for the injured Anthony Richardson . Alec Pierce is fourth on the team with 20 targets but leads the team with 368 receiving yards, thanks largely to his ridiculous 28.3 yards/rec.\nBrock Bowers \u2013 12 target, 8 rec\nBowers bounced back with his best game of the season after combining for just seven targets over the previous two weeks. The rookie is tied with Jakobi Meyers for the team target lead and there\u2019s no reason to believe that will change with Davante Adams and the Raiders likely to part ways. He is the TE1 on the season, though just a half-point in front of George Kittle .\nSan Francisco 49ers Pass Catchers\nSpeaking of Kittle, he leads tight ends with 7.3 targets/game, slightly ahead of Bowers (7.2). He and Brandon Aiyuk led the way with 12 targets each for the 49ers in Week 5. Aiyuk leads the team in both total targets (37) and targets/game (7.4). Deebo Samuel is third in target rate (6.8) and Jauan Jennings is fourth (6.2), though Jennings\u2019 31 targets are the second-highest total on the team.\nDarius Slayton \u2013 11 targets, 8 rec\nWith Malik Nabers out, Slayton stepped in and saw the most targets he\u2019s received in a game since the 2020 season. Slayton led the Giants in targets last season but as long as Nabers returns and Wan\u2019Dale Robinson stays healthy, it\u2019s difficult to envision him repeating that feat. He saw just 15 targets combined over the first four weeks of the season, well behind both Nabers and Robinson.\nDallas Cowboys Pass Catchers\nJalen Tolbert stepped up and led the Cowboys with 10 targets in Week 5, one more than CeeDee Lamb . He\u2019ll look to continue taking advantage of increased opportunities with Brandin Cooks on injured reserve. I should also mention Jake Ferguson , who was targeted seven times on Sunday night and has now seen 25 targets combined over his last three games.\nKansas City Chiefs Pass Catchers\nNo Rashee Rice , no problem? Juju Smith-Schuster stepped up with eight targets Monday night, more than he ever saw with the Patriots last season. Travis Kelce also saw a season-high 10 targets against the Saints. Kelce has now seen double-digit targets in 55(!) career games, including the playoffs.\nKenneth Walker \u2013 8 targets, 7 rec\nWalker\u2019s eight targets in Week 5 tied his career high. He now has 16 targets on the season. That may not seem like much, but it amounts to a 14% target share, nearly double the 7% and 8% rate he averaged over his first two seasons. That kind of bump in passing game usage is a big deal for fantasy football running backs.\nChris Olave \u2013 4 targets, 2 rec\nThings had been trending upward after Olave saw 10 targets in Week 4 but his usage took a step back on Monday night against the Chiefs. He has been over a 25% target share in three games this season but under 15% in the other two, including 13% in Week 5. That brings him to a 22% team target share for the season, tied with Alvin Kamara but trailing Rashid Shaheed (26.8%).\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.
