          "source_data": "Hello everybody and welcome to a new video from the FPL bar, yes, we are almost done with the international break, we are back into content week and at the FPL bar, you can expect a video every week, this week I reckon, we have this little 15-20 minute video today where I built a very fun table for big hitters which is going to hopefully feature on our pod regularly, we have a pod tomorrow where the three of us are back, Pras is off and all, I, all three of us will be back for the pod tomorrow, so keep your eyes peeled out for that and then we'll have our team selection videos from Wednesday through Friday, all three of us, one each, so yeah, lots of content coming, it's so good to be back into FPL mode and I thought it's a nice time to delve into big hitters and actually just wanted to set a standard for wanting to look at big hitters quite regularly because I discussed on the pod previously as well, I think how we deal with big hitters, are they prone to fixture shifts and are big hitters, are some of them fixture proof, what are the trends, how do each of them behave based on their team performances versus opposition of different caliber, I've been doing this for the past few years and this year I have created a table which is a little bit on Nitro Boost compared to the tables that I've done previously as well, so I'm hoping that this is useful for you guys and I'm just hoping that this is going to be a regular feature on the FPL wire, I'm hoping that this is going to be a regular feature on the pod as well, so I hope you enjoy it, I've just created the table today, I built it over the past day or two and I hope that you guys can take the screenshots, share it if you want, give it the necessary credit and draw your own inferences primarily from the video, from the table as well, so this is what I keep doing, last year I created this table when it came to big hitter analysis where I was just hoping to see and find if there are trends when it comes to the performances of these big hitters versus opposition of different caliber, if there are trends between them home and away as well, shout out to Fantasy Football Scout as well because I was able to get this table out quite easily because they give us the points per start data in the members area and then you can filter the points per start or any other data against opposition of different caliber, so I can just go to a table and click I want Harlan's performance points per start versus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 teams, Arsenal, City, Liverpool, Palace, Forest and Everton, now this is the data that I create, this is the table that I created at the end of last year, so what you see out here is the table from the 23-24 season, full season data and what you're seeing here is Harlan's performance points per start against Kolorov opposition, Kolorov opposition is slightly tougher opposition, his performance against middling opposition which is Lescott opposition and his performance against the Bramble opposition which is like the bottom 8 teams, so this data is based on, we don't get this information at the start of the season but just to give clarity and see if we can see trends, this data was calculated by the best performing 6 XGC teams in the Kolorov, the middle 6 teams in the Lescott and the bottom 8 teams for XGC in the Bramble, I also looked at home and away and I just wanted to see if there are trends that we could spot, have a look at this table and let's get a sip of water, so yeah just generally what did we notice last year that might have influenced my decision making this year as well, Harlan was alright against Kolorov opposition, he was alright against Lescott opposition but he was a flat track bully, he was really really good, he was only the second best player in the league against the Bramble opposition in terms of points per start and there was a huge disparity between his home, not a huge disparity between his home and away performance, so he's sort of fixture proof because his Kolorov and Lescott numbers weren't that low last year and he was the best performing away asset as well, so if you're looking for like a set and forget sort of asset, Harlan, I mean obviously you're paying 15 million for him this year but he fit that bill and it's worth remembering last year that Harlan wasn't his fittest best, he had niggling injuries throughout the season, so his season before this which was his debut season was much better than the season you see last year, Palmer absolutely smashed it last year, it's interesting that he did really well against the Kolorov opposition, so he did have a few big game hauls in him, he was really really good and it's important for context because I'm creating this video before game week 8 and Palmer has a tough run of fixtures incoming and FPL manager contemplating how he's going to do, but last year he did pretty all right man against Kolorov opposition, Lescott he was same as Harlan and he was a flat track bully and how he had the most explosive points potential against the easy opposition, 10.1 we've seen signs of that this season already and he was a home game monster, not gonna lie I got in Palmer instead of Saka on my game week 6 wildcard, one of the reasons I did that was because he is a flat track bully, he's a home bully, I saw that there were two home games coming as Brighton and Forest, so I went for it, so last year at least and obviously it's a different manager last year, there's a different manager new this year, when you're looking at all this data you need to apply our own context, now I'm recording this video at midnight so I might forget some of the context but I just wanted to show you guys the data, so you guys can create your own context, form your own trends, let me know in the comments below what context we can add to the information that we see as well, I'm going to show this to Pras and Zorf tomorrow as well and see what they have to do, all right and this is last year data, then this year's data which is the Nitro boosted table is coming in a bit, Forden did well in the Lescott games, not really explosive in the Bramble games, did decently well at home, Mosala interestingly enough wasn't very exclusive against easy opposition, he did really good in the tough games and the middling games, that sort of makes sense because he was a beast for counter-attacks last year and last year he was a home monster which isn't quite the trend, spoiler alert this year, Saka did decently well against Kolorov and Lescott opposition but he wasn't as explosive as Haaland and Palma but he was the third best, after Haaland and Palma it was Saka who was best in the easy fixtures, so he's a good shot for a just set and forget sort of premium if you want to play that way, also he was pretty decent both home and away, Kai was interesting because Kai was just terrible, probably worst out of everybody in the tough fixtures, he just didn't perform but also worth noting that Kai started playing center forward in the second half of the season, now this data that you see is for the entire season, so there is some noise there, I don't have data for Kai just for the second half of the season but that's worth adding, Watkins did really well in the Lescott fixtures, what's worth noting with Watkins is that he had similar points per stat home and away which is also the case this year, so he isn't a home game monster per se, Bruno was just poor last season, Bruno's continued to be poor this season, Son was interesting because he wasn't really explosive against the Bramble opposition, he was really good against the middling opposition as well but he was one of the best performers against the tough opposition, so he's a big game player and again you're thinking about it as an outlet on the counter and Son sort of fit that bill and Isak was a home game monster, did really well as good as Saka in the easy games and did really well at home and obviously you think of St. James' Park and that comes to your mind. If you're looking at the best performers, again the Colorado table, Palmer and Sala and Son did really well, Palmer maybe is a big game player, Mo and Son counterattacking outlets, Foden, Mo and Watkins did well in the Lescott, the flat track bullies were Harland and Palmer and Saka and Isak also showed good correlation. For almost all of them, they did better in the Bramble compared to the Lescott except maybe Foden and Mo and Watkins. That's it, that's the data from last year, now what can we decipher from this year? Yes, this is the fully loaded Nitro Boost version, I'm looking to update this regularly, I hope to feature this in my videos or on the board maybe once in 3-4 weeks, maybe every week we'll see but the data is here for everybody to see. Now what I want to do is start adding sort of inferences and whatever I added to this year's data. I have mentioned it for all the big hitters, I need to add maybe Jackson in there but I'll do it, it's a work in progress, if there are any suggestions that you guys want to make, do let me know. What we've done is I've given point-wise, match-wise breakdown, so how many points did Harland get in these fixtures? It's easy for you to see, it's easy for you to spot trends, what's his underlying data, what's his XGI in these fixtures as well, so you get to spot whether the points correlated to the XGI data as well. I have sort of highlighted the fixtures as per color of Lescott and Bramble, so light green is the easy fixtures, yellow is the middling fixtures and red or orange, if you may call it, is the tougher fixtures. I have given you the averages, his points average as well as his XGI average, I've given the average for home, I've given the average for away, points as well as underlying data, I've given the average against different caliber opposition, points as well as underlying data and in the next seven fixtures, at least in today's table, we can see how many greens are coming and how many reds are coming and how many double digits has this player got so far this season, which sort of indicates explosivity or captaincy potential and while it's just been seven game weeks of data and there's going to be a lot of noise in this data, I'm just going to hope to find and constantly look at this and see if we spot trends, see if there's any running because I feel like if you're going to play with glue guys, you know, if you're going to play with the likes of Raya, Gabriel, Trent, Bumo, TCL who are going to be set and forget picks, what kind of trends can we see or can we try to spot amongst the big hitters and is it worth shifting them? Do we need to shift them? Are they fixture proof? Is this particular big hitter fixture proof? That's the kind of information that we want to get when we're trying to assess performance of these players against different caliber opposition, home and away, etc. You get the drift. So let's get into the nitty-gritties of this table so far. Haaland obviously did really well. Him and Parma are the best performing averages so far at 9.6 points. Their underlying data is also really good. Haaland's 1 XGI per game. Parma and Sala are 0.8 XGI per game so far. Haaland's got the best home average. He's done really well. I mean, look at that. He's got that 17 points against Ipswich at home, 13 points against Brentford at home. So he's done really well at home and so has Parma. Obviously, Parma's average has gone up by that easy home fixture which is a freak game where he had a 3 XGI and 25 points. So his average has gone up because of that. But we've seen last year that Parma tends to do well at home. He's explosive at home and he's explosive in the easy fixture. So, you know, is it validated that he's still a flat-track bully? Yes. Away performance, Haaland did well as well. So did Sala. Sala was a beast away this season. Obviously, a lot of that is down to his 14-pointer against Ipswich and 17-pointer against United and then a 10-pointer against Full Service. So he's done well in his three away games. You know, we are all not paying much attention to Sala and he's not much of a Twitter template etc as well. But he's done well, man. He's got some middling fixtures though. The fixtures aren't the best but it's worth remembering that he did all right in the tough fixtures last year. I think that said, you can just have one Haaland or Sala in a decent sort of structure. At the moment, given the fixtures that Haaland has upcoming in the future, it just has to be Haaland. I'm just going to go sort of player-wise and see what we spot. Haaland did really well. Look at his greens. In his greens, he's done 17-13-2. 1.8 XGI, 1.1 XGI. He's done 17 points in his yellow, which is a West Ham away game. This is as per my judgment. I put the XGC table on this side. I added my own context. Sometimes you will see a different rating for home versus away. And this is going to be a work in progress. I'm open to your suggestions. But what this shows us is that Haaland is prone to fixtures. Like once the fixtures get tough. We saw that last year also. In the tough fixtures, he's not as good. He's much better in the easier fixtures. So he's a flat-track bully. You can afford to sell him when the fixtures get tough is the learning that we have so far. Because the average in the red is 6. It's still better than everybody else. But his 6 in the reds versus everybody else's 10-16-9.3-8.5-8.8 in the greens is better. So it's alright to sell Haaland at the tough fixtures. We can take that leap of faith if we want to. But otherwise, he's great in the greens. He's great in the yellows as well. So far, he's only had one yellow so far. So that's the noise that I'm talking about. But his underlying data is amazing. 1.1 XGI per game average in the greens. 1.8 in the yellows. And he's got two greens coming. More importantly, he only has one red coming. And most of the other guys have two or three reds coming. So he's just got Liverpool away as a tough fixture. Otherwise, the fixtures are just great. Even Bournemouth, Brighton, and Spurs, they're yellows. But I like them from an attacking perspective. Forest is tough. It's more like the Fulham at home game. But these are nice fixtures for attackers. So Wolves, Southampton, this block of five is just great for attackers, which is why Foden is interesting. Unfortunately, we don't have data for Foden this year because subbed in three games, not available data. Only Fulham game, he got two points and an XGI of 0.1. So we'll talk more about Foden on the board tomorrow. But all of it is not available. Okay, his double digits are two and greens coming are two. That's just wrong information at the moment. Harlan is at three double digits, but that's not as much as Mo. Mo's been double digits in four weeks, man. So he's been good. But his underlying data is not as strong as Harlan, where his average is 0.8 XGI compared to Harlan's one. His home average has been not great. His away average is pretty good. That's obviously because of the United Hall and the Wolves Hall and the Ipswich Hall. All three away games he's done well so far, except for the Palace game, he didn't do too well. His XGI data is consistent. Forrest are stifling all the big hitters, you know, they considered only 0.3 XGI against Salah, Palmer against Palmer, they considered 0.5 XGI. So they're decent at stifling tough opposition. Worth noting though that Salah has three reds coming. Arsenal away, City and Newcastle away. I think Newcastle at home is a yellow and Newcastle away is tough because of St. James' Park. And just otherwise, two greens, Brighton at home and Southampton away. So the fixtures, I think if you don't want to go without Mo, it's fine for the next two maybe, because you've got Arsenal away which is one of the toughest fixtures. But we do need to consider or see if we want to have Mo by the time Brighton at home comes in. But that said, Harlan has a tough run of fixtures then as well, so does Mo. Harlan has an easy run of fixtures in 10, 11, 12. So does Mo. I'm hoping you can see the mouse pointer because I'm directing. He's done well in the easy fixtures. He's done recently in the yellows, but he's had no reds so far this season. He was good in the reds last year, but he's had no reds so far this season. All right, when it comes to Palmer, flat track bully has done really well in the greens. In the greens, he's done 17, 6 and 25. And he's clocked a minimum XGI of 0.8 in the greens. And he's got two greens coming. And he's got one, two, three yellows coming. And two reds. In the red against Man City, he just got two points and he was 0.3 XGI. But we saw last year he was good in the reds, in the color of fixtures where he got 7.4 points. So how will he do in these fixtures? I think Arsenal is a tough fixture. I won't be surprised if he can, he gets a return or two against Liverpool because Liverpool this year, I was reading Tom Freeman's article, which is on the scout called the big numbers and Liverpool have conceded the fourth highest chances on counterattacks. And Chelsea have had the most number of shots on counterattacks this season. That matchup adds up. Obviously, that has happened probably because of the Brighton game and the Wolves game maybe because they were sort of crazy open-ended games. But yeah, he's done well in the greens and yellows. He's done equally well home and away. He's got just two reds coming, but he's got two greens coming as well. And two double digits all so far. Same as Saka, you know, we might think that Saka is less explosive compared to Palmer, but he's got the same. It's just that the difference when he goes crazy, he goes berserk. He's got a 17-pointer and a 25-pointer. The 25-pointer is a freak game, but he's got it in him. You know, both are four return games. Saka's underlying data, man, just strong. Like in the greens, he's gotten, except for one game, he's crossed one XGI in all the greens. It's worth noting though, I'll show in the table ahead, that Saka's XGI is dominated by XA, not XG. So especially after Rodegard's gone, he's much more of a creator. Worth noting though, that he's got zero greens coming in the next seven fixtures. Bournemouth away, in my opinion, is yellow. Forest, we saw. Stifel's opposition, West Ham, always yellow. United, you could argue, could be a green, but yeah. And he's got three reds. So after the Bournemouth game, I think Bournemouth is actually a really good fixture for your good teams. You've got like three tough fixtures where you can maybe avoid Saka. How was Saka in the tough opposition last year? 5.6 points per game and 5.8 points per game. So yeah, man. And so far in the tough fixtures, he's got six points and four points and 0.2 and 0.4. So he sort of correlates well with fixtures and he does really well in the easy fixtures as well. Also good average at home, man. Away, he's not bad. That said, Harlan, Salah, Palma are just better away. You know who's the worst away guy, man? He's just not had any returns so far in away games where he's got two points against City away, two points against Villa away, two points against Perse away. All his goals have come at home. Is this a trend that's going to continue? Last year, he had more points away than home. So you know, this could just be noise. And I think he's just proper center forward who's improving. So I think at his price, he's fine as a pick. Worth voting. Is it going to be worth selling him? And is it worth going to do Kai to Solanke later? You know, we'll discuss that on the board tomorrow. Watkins. Watkins has done well in the easy fixtures and not done so well in the tough and middling fixtures. So far in the easy fixtures, despite Ashton not really playing that well, he's done well. Now Watkins and Kai and Solanke data is interesting in the next slide that I'm going to show. But yeah, look at that. 5.0.7 XGI against Leicester away, 13.1.3 XGI against Everton, 6.0.4 XGI and 11.0.5 XGI against Wolves. He's not got a lot of shots, but a lot of shots that he gets. Okay, let me just show you. It's big chances. Him and Solanki, if you see, have the highest xg per shot, so their shots might not be that high in volume, but they have a higher xg per shot. So when they do take shots, they have slightly bigger chances compared to the rest. I just wanted to add that bit of context. He's got three greens coming, yeah? Three nice home fixtures, Bournemouth at home, Palace at home, Renfrew at home. Their home fixtures, which is why I'm giving them a green, and then he's got Fulham away is fine for Watkins. The problem is that Watkins' minutes are a doubt, and they've got like a pretty tough Champions League schedule as well, which is the case for Salah as well, you know, they've got, I think they've got Leipzig away, somewhere between here as well, and after Southampton they have Madrid as well, so they've got Aston Villa, Madrid, Southampton, something, and then Man City. So it's a tough Champions League fixture run for Salah as well, and Liverpool, if you're talking about Trent, Diaz, etc. I will add the fixture table and we'll discuss that on the pod tomorrow, but I just wanted to get this table out for you guys to see and what you'll think. Bruno so far, man, first two games, 1.2 XGI, 0.8 XGI, but just had nothing to show for it. His underlying data is not that bad, you know, 1.2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, but he's just not performed so far, man. He's just not performed. That said, most number of greens coming out of all of them is Bruno, but are United in a good space? That's for you to judge. It's interesting though, because this made me think about defenders. I'm in the market for defenders after Brentford and West Ham. Chelsea is a tough fixture, but these are decent fixtures for clean sheets, man. Leicester at home, Ipswich away, Everton at home. If around game week 11 we have a new manager in place, there's a nice new manager bounce to take advantage of here right now. Can you sort of semi-bluff and put a United player in there, especially someone like Dele O, so that you can take advantage of the new manager bounce? Something to think about, man. All right, son. And Bruno's data last year was nothing to write home about, yeah. All right, am I just recording? Let me check sound. Yes, everything is fine. 22-minute video. I think we'll go for five minutes more and we'll be done. Please hit the like and subscribe button if you like the work that we've done. If you like the data, yes, it's only seven weeks of data, but I'm trying to contextualize and this data is there for mainly to you to see and spot your trends and make your own analysis. In the comments, let me know what you are seeing that I'm not seeing so far in the data, because I've just created this table. So I'll look at it more and let it simmer a little more. What additions can I make to the table? You need to understand it needs to be visible in one image as well. Son is interesting. He's done really well at home. So in the Everton home game, he got 1.2 XGI and 16 points. In the Brentford home game, he got 0.5 XGI and 10 points. He's not done good in the tough games, despite doing good in the tough games last year. But it's like, we don't have much data, but he's got three good home games coming. So Son needs to just be in our thoughts, because there's three greens, all three greens are at home. Best time to switch Fulham. Fulham is not that easy, but just generally decent fixtures for attackers. Same as the case for Solanke. Not much data to write home about, but in the green and the yellow fixtures, Brentford at home, he had 1.7 XGI. That's insane. United away, he had 1.3 XGI, crazy open game, insane. He just had six points to show for it in both occasions. He's just starting to post some really good underlying data. So if Kai has a downturn in performance in these yellow and reds, Solanke has got some greens coming. It's not a necessary move, but if we want to make that move, it's sitting there. Isak at the moment, I just put him in there because I want to track his data and he's going to be fit, but right now we're not looking at Newcastle. All right, I just wanted to shout out that difference between XA and XG for Saka versus everybody else. Saka has the highest XA here, 3.16. Everybody else is below two, so he's the best creator amongst all these players, but that also means that his XG compared to the other big hitters is just less. He's lesser than Watkins, Solanke, Havertz, Salah, Palmer, Haaland for XG, but that said, he's just having such strong underlying data in the easy games, which is why he's good for bonus points. He's fourth for XGI compared to Haaland, Palmer, and Salah. What else do we see? Haaland, most of his data is just XG. Palmer's good XG, second highest XG, actually. Same as Havertz. Havertz and Palmer are second and third for XG compared to the other guys. Palmer obviously has a pen in his locker as well. Salah also has decent XG and decent XA. Palmer also has good XA, you know, it's 1.68. That's why the data is strong. Palmer could just be as... I am very comfortable holding Palmer and have no problems keeping him for a long time. I think he might be fixture-proof as well, as we've seen here, you know, in the 23-24 table. Everybody's performed above their underlying data, and I think that's fine, because is Haaland, Salah, Palmer, Saka elite finishers or supplying to elite finishers? Palmer's not supplying to elite finishers, they're just good players who tend to do above their underlying data. Solanke hasn't done so far, and he's historically a poor finisher. So you have to keep that in mind when you're weighing down XG and XGI data for players. Solanke is probably going to be on par with his underlying data, so that's something you need to worry about. But his XGI data is good, man, and most of that is XG. He's good. Watkins is performing above because his XA is just... His XA, he's always above his XG, XA when it comes to his delta. Haaland always does better compared to his delta, and the only thing I wanted to shout out is that XG per shot for Solanke and Watkins is really high. Look at the XG per shot for Saka, man. He's not getting that many big chances, 0.0 at XG per shot, which is the least amongst the big hitters on this table. I think that's it. That's it from me today in terms of, you know, giving you guys context to big hitters, trends, and big hitter numbers. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Shout out to Sleeper as well. If you guys haven't actually set up a draft with your friends, doing it during the international break is the best time to do so. So download the app by scanning this QR code that you see and just play a draft with your friends. As usual, have a look at this data. Let me know what you think. Hit like, subscribe. Looking forward to your suggestions, and see you on the pot tomorrow with Brass and Zoff. If you like this data, I would appreciate it if you actually give me a shout out on Twitter, YouTube, retweet the post, etc. We do. And take care. Good night, guys.",
          "summary": "This week's fantasy football discussion focuses on the analysis of \"big hitters\" and players' performances in relation to varying fixture difficulties, drawing insights from last season's and the current season's data. A key feature presented is a newly created \"Nitro Boost\" table designed to assess player performances against different tiers of opposition\u2014categorized into Kolorov (tough), Lescott (middling), and Bramble (easier) teams\u2014throughout the 2023-2024 season.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. **Player Analysis**:\n   - **Erling Haaland** remains a standout asset, showcasing strong performances despite some inconsistency against tough opposition. His data indicates he thrives in easier fixtures, reinforcing his value as a flat-track bully.\n   - **Cole Palmer** has demonstrated solid performances, especially at home, confirming his yield as a strong flat-track performer. His data supports the notion that he can offer explosive returns in easier matchups.\n   - **Mohamed Salah**, while solid in tough fixtures, has notable upcoming challenges against strong opposition, which could impact his fantasy value.\n   - **Bukayo Saka** was highlighted for his creative play with high assist potential (XA), but he may lose explosiveness under tougher fixtures as the season progresses.\n   - **Son Heung-min** is presented as an exciting choice, particularly for upcoming home games.\n\n2. **Fixture Strategy**:\n   - The data suggests potential opportunities for strategic transfers based on upcoming fixture difficulty. Players like Haaland and Salah might be worth selling during tougher schedules if alternate high-performing players are available.\n   - Current and upcoming fixtures have been categorized into color-coded sections (green for easy, yellow for moderate, red for tough) for easier visualization of player suitability based on attacking potential.\n\n3. **Trends and Observations**:\n   - Consistent evaluation of players' underlying data (XGI) will be crucial for making informed decisions moving forward, particularly in identifying when players may be deemed fixture-proof or negatively impacted by difficult opponents.\n\nThis episode underscores the importance of data-driven insights in fantasy football strategy, especially in assessing player performance against varying opposition and adjusting lineups accordingly as fixtures evolve. As the season progresses, maintaining flexibility in your squad will be essential, particularly with notable runs of fixtures approaching for key players."
