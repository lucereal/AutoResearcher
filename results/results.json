            "text": "Top 7 Cryptocurrency Trends (2024 & 2025)\nYou may also like:\nThe past year has been a wild ride in the cryptocurrency space.\nOnce ripe with fraud and falling prices, the crypto market surged has surged back in 2024.\nThe cryptocurrency market is currently at a $2.66 trillion market cap, not far off its record high in 2021.\nIn this report, we'll share the biggest trends driving the bull market and inspiring investors.\nPlus, we\u2019ll discuss the regulations and environmental concerns that could shake the market in the near future.\nHere are the crypto trends happening right now and those that are likely to continue through 2025 and beyond.\n1. Bull Market Emerges After Approval of ETFs\nThe value of Bitcoin surged 150% coming into 2024.\nAnd many believe this bull run could last well into 2025 .\nThe price of Bitcoin began 2024 at about $44,000 but had grown to nearly $70,000 by late May.\nIn one survey crypto experts said that Bitcoin could hit $77,000 by the end of 2024 and $123,000 by the end of 2025.\nThe survey respondents predicted a huge surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value between 2025-2030.\nThere are two major factors influencing the bull market: the approval of spot ETFs and the upcoming halving event.\nBrokerages began designing Bitcoin ETFs as early as 2013, but the spot ETF wasn\u2019t approved by the SEC until January 2024 .\nThese funds consist of crypto that\u2019s purchased by the financial firm and then offered as shares to investors. The investors never actually hold any Bitcoin, but the ETF tracks with Bitcoin\u2019s market value.\nDemand for crypto has gone up, in part, because these ETFs allow investors to hold a low-cost investment in Bitcoin without operating in a crypto exchange.\nThis makes crypto more enticing for retail investors but also for wealth management advisors who run 401ks or IRAs .\nBlackRock and Fidelity have emerged as the early leaders in the Bitcoin ETF market \u2014Blackrock holds $15 billion in Bitcoin assets and Fidelity has $9 billion.\nThe Bitcoin halving event is the other factor driving up interest in crypto at the moment.\nSearch interest in \u201cBitcoin halving\u201d jumped in 2020 in the midst of the last event and is increasing dramatically in the lead-up to the next event.\nHalving occurs roughly every four years.\nThe last one happened in April 2024.\nOn the halving event day, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. This decreases the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined.\nMany analysts say that this dip in supply will increase demand.\nPrevious halving events have been followed by an eventual increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price. However, the increase was not immediate and couldn\u2019t be definitively attributed to the halving.\nIn the six months following the last two halvings, there were gains of 51% (in 2016) and 83% (in 2020) .\nThe previous two halving events positively impacted the value of Bitcoin.\nIn one survey, nearly half of crypto experts predicted that gains after the April halving event will peak in the same manner , at the six-month mark.\nNearly 50% of crypto experts say Bitcoin will surpass its all-time high within six months of the halving event.\n2. The Intersection of AI and Crypto\nIn recent months, AI has been working its way into the world of cryptocurrency.\nAI tokens are cryptocurrencies that are directly related to an AI venture.\nJust to name a few examples, AI tokens could be involved in blockchain protocols, decentralized web platforms, and decentralized machine learning platforms.\nSearch volume for \u201cAI tokens\u201d has grown exponentially in 2024.\nAnd the AI tokens can serve a variety of functions .\nUsers can use the tokens to pay for services or access data on the platform, and the platform can use the tokens as rewards to pay users.\nThese tokens can also be used to provide the holders with some level of governance rights.\nThere are nearly 90 AI tokens in the crypto space right now.\nIn April 2023, the combined market value of AI tokens was just $2.7 billion.\nNow it\u2019s surpassed $39 billion .\nFetch.ai is one of the most well-known AI tokens.\nBetween mid-February and mid-March 2024, the value of its token (FET) increased 329% .\nThe platform made headlines in late March when it merged its AI token with tokens from SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol .\nThe merge formed a new token: ASI (artificial superintelligence)\nThe \u201c Superintelligence Alliance \u201d came together with the goal of advancing decentralized AI.\nThe alliance between these three companies is aimed at developing a decentralized approach to AI as opposed to AI protocols and platforms that are dominated by large tech companies.\n3. Funding, Mergers, and Acquisitions in the Crypto Market\n2022 was a year of crypto bankruptcies .\nBut in late 2023, investor confidence returned.\nIn the final quarter of 2023, investors put $1.9 billion into crypto-related companies.\nThe year\u2019s largest investment, valued at $225 million, went to Wormhole . The company has developed a cross-chain connectivity platform.\nWormhole specializes in interoperability between blockchain platforms.\nFast forward to February 2024 when a total of $485 million of VC funding was invested in blockchain startups.\nThat represented a three-month high.\nInvestors say funding in the next year will be focused on real-world applications of blockchain and the infrastructure needed to implement these applications.\nWhen it comes to established crypto companies, the big winners appear to be Bitcoin miners .\nThe stock value of some mining firms has grown more than the value of Bitcoin itself.\nMarathon Digital stock was up 590%.\nCleanSpark was up 440%.\nRiot Platforms was up 350%.\nAs the halving date approaches, industry insiders predict smaller, less efficient mining operations will be acquired by these giants.\nIn February 2024, CleanSpark announced it would take over three mining facilities in Mississippi in a $19.8-million deal.\nSearch volume for \u201cCleanSpark\u201d is up 625% in the past two years.\nIn a merger of equals, Hut 8 Mining and US Bitcoin Corp. merged in November 2023.\nThe new Hut 8 Corp. now has a $1.14 billion market cap.\n4. Increasing Regulation of Cryptocurrency and Exchanges\nThe crypto meltdowns of FTX and others put a direct spotlight on the regulation of the industry.\nAnd, in fact, there wasn\u2019t much regulation at the time.\nSearch volume for \u201ccrypto regulation\u201d is up 104% in recent years.\nHowever, government entities now seem to be making up for lost time and are primed for enforcement.\nThe SEC is the nation\u2019s most active regulatory body in the crypto market.\nGary Gensler, the head of the SEC, has been vocal about his support for more regulation in the crypto market, saying it is \u201crife with fraud and manipulation.\u201d\nThe stance of the SEC is that crypto is a security, functioning much like a stock. That means crypto firms are required to register with the SEC and follow the organization\u2019s disclosure requirements.\nBut this guidance is really the only one on the books and there are virtually no other government entities creating laws or regulations for crypto.\nAnd many crypto supporters say the regulations aren\u2019t clear .\nStill, although other countries have regulations written in law, the United States is the only country to actively enforce regulations against crypto giants.\nIn June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase for not registering as a broker.\nThe SEC charged Coinbase in June 2023.\nThe SEC also sued Binance that month, accusing the crypto exchange of mishandling customer funds.\nThe company was ordered to pay $4 billion in fines in late 2023.\nBinance was charged and ordered to pay $4 billion in financial penalties.\nIn all, the SEC sued five crypto companies in 2023.\nSome indirect regulations are also coming from The White House.\nPresident Biden has pushed for a 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining .\nAs the U.S. government moves toward increasing regulatory scrutiny, some crypto companies are exploring options in other countries.\nThe fight between regulators and crypto companies is motivating some of the companies to look at options abroad.\nNearly 80% of the crypto exchanges registered in the U.S. are also operating in at least one other country.\nThere are several recent examples.\nGemini is looking to make moves in the United Arab Emirates .\nCoinbase opened operations in Bermuda .\nBoth cited regulatory concerns as a prime motivator for launching non-U.S. operations.\n5. Crypto\u2019s Growing Climate Impact\nA lesser-known but potentially pressing trend for the crypto industry is the sector\u2019s energy and climate change implications.\nThe environmental problems lie within a step of the cryptocurrency mining process called proof of work .\nThis is a process that requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems via high levels of computing power before they can submit new blocks to the network.\nThis high-level computing requires an extraordinary amount of energy and water.\nAccording to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, the production of the cryptocurrency uses about 1174 TWh of electricity per year\u2014more than the total annual electricity usage of the Netherlands.\nPut another way, a single transaction of Bitcoin uses the same amount of energy as an average US household for nearly 26 days .\nCrypto mining is an energy-intensive process.\nIn addition, United Nations scientists found that 67% of the energy used in crypto mining comes from fossil fuels.\nThey reported that the carbon emissions from crypto mining alone could push the world beyond climate goals made in the Paris Agreement.\nRiot Platform\u2019s mining operation is the largest in the United States .\nAnd it\u2019s not just electricity.\nMining crypto also requires an abundance of water.\nIn addition to being used for electricity generation, water is used to cool the computer systems and provide the right level of humidity for the machines.\nOne study found that Bitcoin\u2019s annual water consumption could be as high as 2,237 GL (gigaliters).\nThat\u2019s equal to the annual amount of water usage in Washington D.C.\nIn an effort to address climate concerns, Ethereum launched The Merge in 2022, a software upgrade that cut miners\u2019 energy use by 99%.\nThe upgrade got rid of proof of work and replaced it with proof of stake, a verification method that utilizes cryptocurrency holdings.\nHowever, Bitcoin will likely never switch to a proof-of-stake model .\n6. Real-World Assets Turn Digital with Blockchain Technology\nAsset tokenization is another trend that takes advantage of the technology behind crypto: blockchain.\nSearch volume for \u201ctokenized assets\u201d since 2019.\nWhen a real-world asset (RWA) is tokenized that means there\u2019s a digital representation of it on the blockchain.\nTokens can represent all kinds of assets like real estate, art, bonds, intellectual property, and more.\nTokenization can enable the automation of specific actions regarding the asset, provide traceability, enable fractional ownership, and increase liquidity\u2014just to name a few benefits.\nTokenizing an asset enables a host of benefits.\nFinancial institutions are taking an interest in tokenization.\nBlackRock launched its first tokenized asset fund , called BUIDL, in 2024.\nThe fund utilizes the Ethereum blockchain.\nSecuritize , a firm specializing in digital asset tokenization, has partnered with BlackRock on the fund.\nIn its first week, the fund brought in $240 million .\nCitigroup is also testing the tokenization of financial assets on a private blockchain.\nThe bank has said that this will enable clients to transfer their assets on a 24/7 basis and cut processing times down to mere minutes.\nPredictions show that there\u2019s a growing interest in tokenization of assets.\nThe market was valued at $2.81 billion in 2023 but could reach $9.82 billion by 2030 , hitting a CAGR of nearly 20%.\nPredictions from Boston Consulting Group are even more optimistic.\nAnalysts say that up to $16 trillion worth of real-world assets could be tokenized by 2030.\nTokenized assets could represent 10% of global GDP by 2030.\n7. Global Officials Explore Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)\nBanking systems across the world are in the process of developing their own digital currency, referred to as Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\nSearch volume for \u201cCBDC\u201d over the last 5 years.\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, this would create a virtual currency that is centralized and managed by central banks as opposed to decentralized blockchains.\nThere is hope that this type of currency would offer the benefits of crypto without the risk.\nDigital currencies are currently being developed or tested in 132 countries , which amounts to 98% of the world\u2019s GDP.\nMany countries in Europe are piloting CBDCs.\nCBDCs are already fully operational in Jamaica, Nigeria, and the Bahamas.\nChina is piloting the largest CBDC trial in the world.\nThe digital yuan, called e-CNY, is being tested in 260 million wallets across 25 cities.\nBy 2030, the Bank of International Settlements says 15 retail CBDCs (those used by consumers and businesses) and 9 wholesale CBDCs (those used by banks) will be operational.\nThe Bank for International Settlements says that more CBDCs are coming soon.\nTo connect various CBDC, the bank messaging network SWIFT is planning to launch a network of CBDC platforms in the next year or two.\nThe goal of the network is to enable the cross-border use of various CBDCs and enable banks to continue to use their existing infrastructure to manage transactions.\nThe organization has already tested its network with 38 banks and financial platforms.\nDespite growing global interest, officials in the United States say they have no plans to develop CBDC .\nThe Fed has said that any CBDC would be subject to congressional approval.\nU.S. consumers have been vocal about their privacy concerns regarding CBDC.\nIn addition, bank officials worry that digital currency could negatively impact the cost and availability of credit, set up commercial banks for possible failure, and decrease the stability of the financial system as a whole.\nConclusion\nThat concludes our list of the top seven crypto trends to watch right now.\nThe cryptocurrency market has been almost completely unpredictable over the last several years. The bull market has been in control for the past few months, giving investors and crypto enthusiasts hope for a record-setting future.\nBut with increasing regulation and climate impacts, it seems nearly inevitable that crypto\u2019s future will be just as uncertain as its past.\nFind Thousands of Trending Topics With Our Platform\nExplore\nCompany\nConnect\n548 Market St. Suite 95149 San Francisco, California",
