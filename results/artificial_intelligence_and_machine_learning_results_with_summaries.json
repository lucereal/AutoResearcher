            "text": "This wide-ranging guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise provides the building blocks for becoming successful business consumers of AI technologies. It starts with introductory explanations of AI's history, how AI works and the main types of AI. The importance and impact of AI is covered next, followed by information on AI's key benefits and risks, current and potential AI use cases, building a successful AI strategy, steps for implementing AI tools in the enterprise and technological breakthroughs that are driving the field forward. Throughout the guide, we include hyperlinks to TechTarget articles that provide more detail and insights on the topics discussed.\n10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024\nCustom enterprise models, open source AI, multimodal -- learn about the top AI and machine learning trends for 2024 and how they promise to transform the industry.\nAfter the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, 2023 marked a turning point in artificial intelligence . The past year's developments, from a vibrant open source landscape to sophisticated multimodal models, have laid the groundwork for significant advances in AI .\nBut although generative AI continues to captivate the tech world, attitudes are becoming more nuanced and mature as organizations shift their focus from experimentation to real-world initiatives. This year's trends reflect a deepening sophistication and caution in AI development and deployment strategies , with an eye to ethics, safety and the evolving regulatory landscape.\nHere are the top 10 AI and machine learning trends to prepare for in 2024.\n1. Multimodal AI\nMultimodal AI goes beyond traditional single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information.\n\"The interfaces of the world are multimodal,\" said Mark Chen, head of frontiers research at OpenAI, in a November 2023 presentation at the conference EmTech MIT. \"We want our models to see what we see and hear what we hear, and we want them to also generate content that appeals to more than one of our senses.\"\nThis article is part of\nA guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise\nThe multimodal capabilities in OpenAI's GPT-4 model enable the software to respond to visual and audio input. In his talk, Chen gave the example of taking photos of the inside of a fridge and asking ChatGPT to suggest a recipe based on the ingredients in the photo. The interaction could even encompass an audio element if using ChatGPT's voice mode to pose the request aloud.\nAlthough most generative AI initiatives today are text-based, \"the real power of these capabilities is going to be when you can marry up text and conversation with images and video, cross-pollinate all three of those, and apply those to a variety of businesses,\" said Matt Barrington, Americas emerging technologies leader at EY.\nMultimodal AI's real-world applications are diverse and expanding. In healthcare, for example, multimodal models can analyze medical images in light of patient history and genetic information to improve diagnostic accuracy. At the job function level, multimodal models can expand what various employees can do by extending basic design and coding capabilities to individuals without a formal background in those areas.\n\"I can't draw to save my life,\" Barrington said. \"Well, now I can. I'm decent with language, so ... I can plug into a capability like [image generation], and some of those ideas that were in my head that I could never physically draw, I can have AI do.\"\nMoreover, introducing multimodal capabilities could strengthen models by offering them new data to learn from. \"As our models get better and better at modeling language and start to hit the limits of what they can learn from language, we want to provide the models with raw inputs from the world so that they can perceive the world on their own and draw their own inferences from things like video or audio data,\" Chen said.\n2. Agentic AI\nAgentic AI marks a significant shift from reactive to proactive AI. AI agents are advanced systems that exhibit autonomy, proactivity and the ability to act independently. Unlike traditional AI systems, which mainly respond to user inputs and follow predetermined programming, AI agents are designed to understand their environment, set goals and act to achieve those objectives without direct human intervention.\nFor example, in environmental monitoring , an AI agent could be trained to collect data, analyze patterns and initiate preventive actions in response to hazards such as early signs of a forest fire. Likewise, a financial AI agent could actively manage an investment portfolio using adaptive strategies that react to changing market conditions in real time.\n\"2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI,\" wrote computer scientist Peter Norvig, a fellow at Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, in a recent blog post . \"In 2024, we'll see the ability for agents to get stuff done for you. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.\"\nIn addition, combining agentic and multimodal AI could open up new possibilities. In the aforementioned presentation, Chen gave the example of an application designed to identify the contents of an uploaded image. Previously, someone looking to build such an application would have needed to train their own image recognition model and then figure out how to deploy it. But with multimodal, agentic models, this could all be accomplished through natural language prompting.\n\"I really think that multimodal together with GPTs will open up the no-code development of computer vision applications, just in the same way that prompting opened up the no-code development of a lot of text-based applications,\" Chen said.\n3. Open source AI\nBuilding large language models and other powerful generative AI systems is an expensive process that requires enormous amounts of compute and data. But using an open source model enables developers to build on top of others' work, reducing costs and expanding AI access. Open source AI is publicly available, typically for free, enabling organizations and researchers to contribute to and build on existing code.\nGitHub data from the past year shows a remarkable increase in developer engagement with AI, particularly generative AI. In 2023, generative AI projects entered the top 10 most popular projects across the code hosting platform for the first time, with projects such as Stable Diffusion and AutoGPT pulling in thousands of first-time contributors.\nEarly in the year, open source generative models were limited in number, and their performance often lagged behind proprietary options such as ChatGPT. But the landscape broadened significantly over the course of 2023 to include powerful open source contenders such as Meta's Llama 2 and Mistral AI's Mixtral models. This could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape in 2024 by providing smaller, less resourced entities with access to sophisticated AI models and tools that were previously out of reach.\n\"It gives everyone easy, fairly democratized access, and it's great for experimentation and exploration,\" Barrington said.\nOpen source approaches can also encourage transparency and ethical development, as more eyes on the code means a greater likelihood of identifying biases, bugs and security vulnerabilities. But experts have also expressed concerns about the misuse of open source AI to create disinformation and other harmful content . In addition, building and maintaining open source is difficult even for traditional software, let alone complex and compute-intensive AI models.\n4. Retrieval-augmented generation\nAlthough generative AI tools were widely adopted in 2023, they continue to be plagued by the problem of hallucinations : plausible-sounding but incorrect responses to users' queries. This limitation has presented a roadblock to enterprise adoption, where hallucinations in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios could be catastrophic. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a technique for reducing hallucinations, with potentially profound implications for enterprise AI adoption.\nRAG blends text generation with information retrieval to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. It enables LLMs to access external information, helping them produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Bypassing the need to store all knowledge directly in the LLM also reduces model size, which increases speed and lowers costs.\n\"You can use RAG to go gather a ton of unstructured information, documents, etc., [and] feed it into a model without having to fine-tune or custom-train a model,\" Barrington said.\nThese benefits are particularly enticing for enterprise applications where up-to-date factual knowledge is crucial. For example, businesses can use RAG with foundation models to create more efficient and informative chatbots and virtual assistants.\n5. Customized enterprise generative AI models\nMassive, general-purpose tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT have attracted the most attention among consumers exploring generative AI. But for business use cases, smaller, narrow-purpose models could prove to have the most staying power, driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can meet niche requirements.\nWhile creating a new model from scratch is a possibility, it's a resource-intensive proposition that will be out of reach for many organizations. To build customized generative AI , most organizations instead modify existing AI models -- for example, tweaking their architecture or fine-tuning on a domain-specific data set. This can be cheaper than either building a new model from the ground up or relying on API calls to a public LLM .\n\"Calls to GPT-4 as an API, just as an example, are very expensive, both in terms of cost and in terms of latency -- how long it can actually take to return a result,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of AI and machine learning at Workday. \"We are working a lot ... on optimizing so that we have the same capability, but it's very targeted and specific. And so it can be a much smaller model that's more manageable.\"\nThe key advantage of customized generative AI models is their ability to cater to niche markets and user needs. Tailored generative AI tools can be built for almost any scenario, from customer support to supply chain management to document review. This is especially relevant for sectors with highly specialized terminology and practices, such as healthcare , finance and legal.\nIn many business use cases, the most massive LLMs are overkill. Although ChatGPT might be the state of the art for a consumer-facing chatbot designed to handle any query, \"it's not the state of the art for smaller enterprise applications,\" Luke said.\nBarrington expects to see enterprises exploring a more diverse range of models in the coming year as AI developers' capabilities begin to converge. \"We're expecting, over the next year or two, for there to be a much higher degree of parity across the models -- and that's a good thing,\" he said.\nOn a smaller scale, Luke has seen a similar scenario play out at Workday, which provides a set of AI services for teams to experiment with internally. Although employees started out using mostly OpenAI services, Luke said, he's gradually seen a shift toward a mix of models from various providers, including Google and AWS.\nBuilding a customized model rather than using an off-the-shelf public tool often also improves privacy and security, as it gives organizations greater control over their data. Luke gave the example of building a model for Workday tasks that involve handling sensitive personal data, such as disability status and health history. \"Those aren't things that we're going to want to send out to a third party,\" he said. \"Our customers generally wouldn't be comfortable with that.\"\nIn light of these privacy and security benefits, stricter AI regulation in the coming years could push organizations to focus their energies on proprietary models, explained Gillian Crossan, risk advisory principal and global technology sector leader at Deloitte.\n\"It's going to encourage enterprises to focus more on private models that are proprietary, that are domain-specific, rather than focus on these large language models that are trained with data from all over the internet and everything that that brings with it,\" she said.\n6. Need for AI and machine learning talent\nDesigning, training and testing a machine learning model is no easy feat -- much less pushing it to production and maintaining it in a complex organizational IT environment. It's no surprise, then, that the growing need for AI and machine learning talent is expected to continue into 2024 and beyond .\n\"The market is still really hot around talent,\" Luke said. \"It's very easy to get a job in this space.\"\nIn particular, as AI and machine learning become more integrated into business operations, there's a growing need for professionals who can bridge the gap between theory and practice. This requires the ability to deploy, monitor and maintain AI systems in real-world settings -- a discipline often referred to as MLOps , short for machine learning operations.\nIn a recent O'Reilly report , respondents cited AI programming, data analysis and statistics, and operations for AI and machine learning as the top three skills their organizations needed for generative AI projects. These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That's going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said.\nIn 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation.\nCrossan also emphasized the importance of diversity in AI initiatives at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\"\n7. Shadow AI\nAs employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the issue of shadow AI : use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently.\nShadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes.\nOn the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties.\n\"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there's a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that's appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\"\nIn 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear acceptable AI use policies and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI.\n\"The reality is, everybody's using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY research finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\"\n8. A generative AI reality check\nAs organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they're likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the Gartner Hype Cycle .\n\"We're definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we've been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], 'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?'\" Barrington said.\nAs early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI's limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated.\n\"It's actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production in a real product setting,\" Luke said.\nThe silver lining is that these growing pains, while unpleasant in the short term, could result in a healthier, more tempered outlook in the long run. Moving past this phase will require setting realistic expectations for AI and developing a more nuanced understanding of what AI can and can't do. AI projects should be clearly tied to business goals and practical use cases, with a clear plan in place for measuring outcomes .\n\"If you have very loose use cases that are not clearly defined, that's probably what's going to hold you up the most,\" Crossan said.\n9. Increased attention to AI ethics and security risks\nThe proliferation of deepfakes and sophisticated AI-generated content is raising alarms about the potential for misinformation and manipulation in media and politics, as well as identity theft and other types of fraud. AI can also enhance the efficacy of ransomware and phishing attacks, making them more convincing, more adaptable and harder to detect.\nAlthough efforts are underway to develop technologies for detecting AI-generated content , doing so remains challenging. Current AI watermarking techniques are relatively easy to circumvent, and existing AI detection software can be prone to false positives.\nThe increasing ubiquity of AI systems also highlights the importance of ensuring that they are transparent and fair -- for example, by carefully vetting training data and algorithms for bias. Crossan emphasized that these ethics and compliance considerations should be interwoven throughout the process of developing an AI strategy.\n\"You have to be thinking about, as an enterprise ... implementing AI, what are the controls that you're going to need?\" she said. \"And that starts to help you plan a bit for the regulation so that you're doing it together. You're not doing all of this experimentation with AI and then [realizing], 'Oh, now we need to think about the controls.' You do it at the same time.\"\nSafety and ethics can also be another reason to look at smaller, more narrowly tailored models, Luke pointed out. \"These smaller, tuned, domain-specific models are just far less capable than the really big ones -- and we want that,\" he said. \"They're less likely to be able to output something that you don't want because they're just not capable of as many things.\"\n10. Evolving AI regulation\nUnsurprisingly, given these ethics and security concerns, 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for AI regulation , with laws, policies and industry frameworks rapidly evolving in the U.S. and globally. Organizations will need to stay informed and adaptable in the coming year, as shifting compliance requirements could have significant implications for global operations and AI development strategies.\nThe EU's AI Act, on which members of the EU's Parliament and Council recently reached a provisional agreement , represents the world's first comprehensive AI law. If adopted, it would ban certain uses of AI, impose obligations for developers of high-risk AI systems and require transparency from companies using generative AI, with noncompliance potentially resulting in multimillion-dollar fines. And it's not just new legislation that could have an effect in 2024.\n\"Interestingly enough, the regulatory issue that I see could have the biggest impact is GDPR -- good old-fashioned GDPR -- because of the need for rectification and erasure, the right to be forgotten, with public large language models,\" Crossan said. \"How do you control that when they're learning from massive amounts of data, and how can you assure that you've been forgotten?\"\nTogether with the GDPR, the AI Act could position the EU as a global AI regulator, potentially influencing AI use and development standards worldwide. \"They're certainly ahead of where we are in the U.S. from an AI regulatory perspective,\" Crossan said.\nThe U.S. doesn't yet have comprehensive federal legislation comparable to the EU's AI Act, but experts encourage organizations not to wait to think about compliance until formal requirements are in force. At EY, for example, \"we're engaging with our clients to get ahead of it,\" Barrington said. Otherwise, businesses could find themselves playing catch-up when regulations do come into effect.\nBeyond the ripple effects of European policy, recent activity in the U.S. executive branch also suggests how AI regulation could play out stateside. President Joe Biden's October executive order implemented new mandates, such as requiring AI developers to share safety test results with the U.S. government and imposing restrictions to protect against the risks of AI in engineering dangerous biological materials. Various federal agencies have also issued guidance targeting specific sectors, such as NIST's AI Risk Management Framework and the Federal Trade Commission's statement warning businesses against making false claims about their products' AI use.\nFurther complicating matters, 2024 is an election year in the U.S., and the current slate of presidential candidates shows a wide range of positions on tech policy questions . A new administration could theoretically change the executive branch's approach to AI oversight through reversing or revising Biden's executive order and nonbinding agency guidance.\nLev Craig covers AI and machine learning as the site editor for TechTarget Enterprise AI.\nRelated Resources\nDig Deeper on AI technologies\nGenAI evolving, remains dominant data and analytics trend\nGPT-4o vs. GPT-4: How do they compare?\nIBM moves ahead with open source, multi-model AI strategy\nGemini 1.5 Pro explained: Everything you need to know\nFeatures including native integrations with development platforms and automatic provisioning of serverless compute enable ...\nThe longtime analytics vendor's latest release addresses the accuracy of artificial intelligence outputs and includes an ...\nUsing AI and ML in a data warehouse gives the whole organization a single source of truth that can align decision making and ...\nSharp HealthCare's cloud strategy spans public, private and SaaS platforms to reduce vendor dependency and emphasizes knowledge ...\nWhile the DOJ assesses remedies for Google's illegal control over online search, it's also heavily focused on AI and the future.\nSuboptimal software fixes cost time and money as well as strain departments throughout the organization.

Its growth has been exponential and shows no signs of slowing down.\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to take a deep dive into the top machine learning trends of 2023, which are:\nWe\u2019ll explore the latest developments and applications, and peer into the future of this exciting field.\nSo, let\u2019s get started. \ud83d\udc47\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). It uses data and algorithms to make predictions without being specifically programmed how to do it.\nML is able to imitate the way that humans are taught. It can learn from historical data, identify patterns, make decisions, and gradually improve its accuracy.\nWhy is machine learning important?\nMachine learning has become an invaluable tool for numerous industries, helping companies to work more accurately, efficiently, and competitively.\nML\u2019s ability to analyze large quantities of data means that it can provide businesses with key insights into customer behaviors, market trends, and operational patterns, as well as drive the development of innovative new products.\nML is accelerating the growth of various industries. It can automate tasks through virtual assistant solutions to free up valuable time for employees, contribute to better treatment methods for hospital patients, and enhance fraud detection and portfolio management in banking and financial services, to give just a few examples.\nA brief history of machine learning\nNow we understand what machine learning is and why it\u2019s so important, where exactly did it all begin?\nHere\u2019s a brief timeline of the history of ML:\nThe 8 most popular machine learning trends in 2023\nAs you can see, machine learning has greatly evolved over the last 80 years, and it\u2019s only continuing to advance in sophistication.\nSo, what are the current big trends in machine learning? We\u2019ve put together a list of the most popular and exciting developments in 2023 that\u2019ll dictate the future of this technology.\n1. General Adversarial Network (GAN)\nGeneral Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are a kind of neural network structure that uses two sub-models to generate new data. These sub-models are called the generator and the discriminator model.\nThe generator creates fake data, and the discriminator tries to determine whether the data is real or fake.\nThe two models are trained in an adversarial zero-sum game until the generator is able to create more believable data, and the discriminator model is able to be tricked by it more than half the time.\nGANs are used to generate examples for image datasets, translate images from one domain to another, create future frames of videos based on a given sequence of past frames, and generate 3D models of objects, and scenes from 2D images, just to give you a few examples.\n2. Low-code and no-code machine learning\nLow-code and no-code ML solutions allow anyone who doesn\u2019t have extensive coding expertise to develop AI applications.\nThey have a graphical user interface (GUI) with pre-built components including algorithms, data preprocessing tools, and model evaluation metrics.\nWith the two solutions, you can drag and drop the components into a pipeline to assemble them. This way, users can choose the elements they want to include in their applications and specify the parameters.\nLow-code and no-code are only going to increase in popularity, as they\u2019re so accessible, convenient, and easy to use.\n3. Embedded ML/TinyML\nEmbedded ML, also known as TinyML, allows machine learning models to run on embedded systems that use microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are small computers designed for a special purpose.\nWith embedded ML/TinyML, you can incorporate AI algorithms directly into devices and systems, and utilize edge computing for real-time processing on the devices.\nInitially, the machine learning system is trained on existing data, and then embedded into the device or system. Then the device or system can make predictions based on incoming data without needing to transfer and process the data somewhere else.\nTinyML backs up Internet of Things (IoT) systems which enables them to efficiently process and analyze large quantities of data whilst using up minimal power.\nTinyML is continuing to grow in adoption. According to ABI Research , TinyML device shipments are set to increase to 2.5 billion in 2030, which is up from 15 million in 2020.\n4. Multimodal machine learning (MML)\nMultimodal machine learning (MML) is based on the concept that the world can be perceived through multiple modalities.\nMultimodality in AI refers to machine learning models that can simultaneously perceive a situation through multiple modalities, similar to what a human can do. Therefore, an ML model being able to perceive the complexities of the world and understand different modalities and how they\u2019re experienced is extremely valuable.\nBy effectively working with different modalities such as text, images, and audio, MML models are able to make predictions or decisions based on an amalgamation of data, which improves its accuracy and overall performance.\nMML can also be utilized in complex applications such as robotics and autonomous systems, where it\u2019s critical to understand and react to inputs like sensor data, video, and speech.\n5. Machine learning operations (MLOps)\nMLOps combines the development and deployment of ML systems to create a more streamlined and efficient process.\nData scientists, DevOps engineers, and IT use MLOps to collaborate more effectively and accelerate model development and production by implementing continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices with appropriate monitoring, validation, and governance.\nIn short, MLOps provides a set of guidelines and best practices to develop machine learning applications in the most reliable and systematic way.\n6. Automated machine learning (AutoML)\nAutoML is a technology that automates machine learning tasks. This means that it can increase the efficiency of building models, free up time for data scientists to focus on more value-added tasks, and enhance the accuracy of models.\nAutoML has become so popular in 2023 because:\n7. Unsupervised machine learning\nUnsupervised machine learning is designed to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets and identify patterns and groups. It requires no human intervention and is ideal for handling large quantities of data that can\u2019t be labeled manually.\nUnsupervised machine learning groups data points with shared features to understand the patterns and relationships between different data sets. As such, it can help users perform accurate and efficient data analysis, and carry out effective cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition activities.\n8. Responsible AI\nAs ML increases in adoption and accessibility, more organizations are recognizing the importance of responsible AI. Responsible AI refers to the ethical, safe, and transparent use of AI systems.\nBusinesses must consider the impact that AI systems have on their employees, customers, and general society, and ensure they:\nMore organizations are incorporating ethical principles into the design of AI systems. For example, Microsoft has developed a \u2018 Responsible AI Standard \u2019 framework for building AI systems, which is based on six principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.\nThe future of machine learning\nNow that we know all about this year\u2019s most popular machine learning trends, what does the future hold for ML?\nWe\u2019re continuing to see new advancements and breakthroughs in the field of AI and machine learning, particularly in industries such as healthcare, programming, finance, transportation, education, and retail.\nNew platforms continue to be developed in order to assist with data collection, classification, model building, training, and deployment.\nThese advancements will further encourage automation and subsequently result in less need for human intervention. But with the rise of ML also comes a rise in data security risks and ethical concerns, sparking the need for new rules and regulations to be put in place.\nLike what you see?

We looked at the publication trends associated with AI and stone disease, including both clinical and surgical applications, and training in endourology. Methods: Through a MeshTerms research on PubMed, we performed a comprehensive review from 1994-2023 for all published articles on \"AI, ML, VR, and Radiomics.\" Articles were then divided into three categories as follows: A-Clinical (Nonsurgical), B-Clinical (Surgical), and C-Training articles, and articles were then assigned to following three periods: Period-1 (1994-2003), Period-2 (2004-2013), and Period-3 (2014-2023). Results: A total of 343 articles were noted (Groups A-129, B-163, and C-51), and trends increased from Period-1 to Period-2 at 123% ( p = 0.009) and to period-3 at 453% ( p = 0.003). This increase from Period-2 to Period-3 for groups A, B, and C was 476% ( p = 0.019), 616% (0.001), and 185% ( p < 0.001), respectively. Group A articles included rise in articles on \"stone characteristics\" (+2100%; p = 0.011), \"renal function\" ( p = 0.002), \"stone diagnosis\" (+192%), \"prediction of stone passage\" (+400%), and \"quality of life\" (+1000%). Group B articles included rise in articles on \"URS\" (+2650%, p = 0.008), \"PCNL\"(+600%, p = 0.001), and \"SWL\" (+650%, p = 0.018). Articles on \"Targeting\" (+453%, p < 0.001), \"Outcomes\" (+850%, p = 0.013), and \"Technological Innovation\" ( p = 0.0311) had rising trends. Group C articles included rise in articles on \"PCNL\" (+300%, p = 0.039) and \"URS\" (+188%, p = 0.003). Conclusion: Publications on AI and its subset areas for urolithiasis have seen an exponential increase over the last decade, with an increase in surgical and nonsurgical clinical areas, as well as in training. Future AI related growth in the field of endourology and urolithiasis is likely to improve training, patient centered decision-making, and clinical outcomes.\nKeywords: AI; PCNL; kidney calculi; shockwave lithotripsy; simulation; ureteroscopy; urolithiasis.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\nCited by\nPublication types\nMeSH terms\nRelated information\nLinkOut - more resources\nFull Text Sources\nNCBI Literature Resources\nMeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
