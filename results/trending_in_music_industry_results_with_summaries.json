                  "text_content": "More From Forbes\nReleasing A Song: Four Effective Marketing Strategies\nJustin Grome, Founder & CEO of Clonefluence , helping thousands grow their online presence with networking tactics.\n\nReleasing a song involves more than just hitting \"upload\" and waiting for people to find it. Successful music releases require preparation, planning and effective marketing strategies to ensure that your track gets the attention it deserves. Based on my experience working with musicians seeking to grow their brands, here are four steps you can take before releasing a song, with a focus on how to market it effectively.\n1. Build anticipation with teasers and pre-saves.\nTo create anticipation for your song before its release, avoid dropping it without any prior announcement. Start by sharing brief teasers\u201415- to 30-second clips\u2014on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok or Twitter. This could include teasers of the chorus, a catchy hook or even a behind-the-scenes look at the recording process.\nIn addition, consider setting up pre-saves on platforms like Spotify. Pre-saves enable your fans to automatically save your track to their library once it's released, which can help boost your streaming numbers from the start. The more people who pre-save, the stronger your launch day is likely to be, increasing your chances of getting noticed by algorithms or playlist curators.\n2. Create a content strategy around the release.\nA well-executed content strategy can help keep your song in the minds of your audience. Don't just promote the song once and move on; think long-term. Plan out content for the weeks leading up to the release and for at least two weeks after. This could include videos, live Q&A sessions, lyric reveals, behind-the-scenes clips and creative posts that tie into the song's message or vibe. For instance, when Taylor Swift released her album Midnights in 2022, she used a series of TikTok videos called \"Midnights Mayhem With Me\" to reveal track titles, building excitement over several weeks.\n\u2018This Needs To Stop\u2019\u2014Tesla Billionaire Elon Musk Issues \u2018Staggering\u2019 Fed \u2018Bankruptcy\u2019 Warning After Sparking Bitcoin Price Panic\nMicrosoft Windows Deadline\u201410 Days To Update Or Stop Using Your PC\nWhat To Know About Liam Payne\u2019s Death: Zayn Malik Postpones Shows, Cowell And Cole React\nMake sure your social media posts are consistent across all platforms. Each post should convey a narrative, whether it's about the inspiration behind the song or how the track reflects your journey as an artist. Use trending hashtags, and engage with your followers by asking them to share their reactions or cover the song. This continuous promotion can help keep your track in circulation and ensure it reaches new listeners daily.\n3. Reach out to blogs, playlists and influencers.\nWhen marketing your song, I recommend seeking validation from influential platforms and tastemakers in addition to using your social channels. Reach out to blogs, playlist curators and influencers in your genre several weeks before your release date. Being featured on a popular blog or playlist or having influencers share your track with their followers can significantly expand your audience.\nTo do this, craft a professional pitch email or message and include a personal note explaining why you believe your song would resonate with their audience. Additionally, provide a press kit or an electronic press kit (EPK) containing all relevant information about your song, including artwork and a brief bio. In my experience, creating an effective EPK can significantly boost your chances of getting noticed by industry professionals. The more exposure you can get for your song, the better.\n4. Prepare your visuals and branding.\nTake your song's release to the next level by paying attention to the visuals and branding that go along with your music. Create eye-catching artwork, compelling video content and engaging social media graphics to help your brand stand out. Your cover art should convey a story that complements the song. If possible, consider making a music video, a lyric video or a series of visual snippets to go along with your release strategy.\nConsistency is important\u2014make sure your branding across different platforms reflects the mood or message of the song. Whether it's the fonts you use or the color schemes, everything should feel unified. Great visuals can not only help you connect with your audience but also make your content more shareable, which is especially important in today's digital age where attention spans are short.\nIn Summary\nA successful song release should include a solid marketing plan in place to ensure it reaches as many people as possible. From generating excitement through teasers and pre-saves to planning a content strategy, collaborating with influencers and creating engaging visuals, the steps you take before your release day are just as important as the day itself. Give your music the best chance to shine by laying the groundwork early and making sure your marketing is as polished as the track itself.\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

              "summary": "### Summary of Recent Trends in the Music Industry\n\nThe music industry continues to evolve rapidly, particularly in the realm of song releases and marketing strategies. Recent insights highlight several key developments that artists can leverage for successful releases:\n\n1. **Effective Marketing Prior to Release**: Artists are encouraged to build anticipation for their songs through teasers and pre-save strategies. Engaging the audience with 15- to 30-second clips on platforms like Instagram and TikTok has become crucial in capturing interest ahead of launch day. Pre-saves on streaming platforms like Spotify can also significantly enhance initial streaming numbers and improve the odds of algorithmic favor.\n\n2. **Content Strategy**: A long-term content strategy is vital. Artists should plan promotional activities not just around the release, but also during the weeks leading up to and following the launch. Consistency across social media platforms is essential, utilizing trending hashtags and engaging with followers to maintain momentum.\n\n3. **Collaborations with Influencers**: Reaching out to blogs, playlists, and industry influencers several weeks prior to release can amplify visibility. Professional pitches and a well-crafted electronic press kit (EPK) can facilitate greater exposure, allowing artists to tap into new audiences.\n\n4. **Visual Branding**: Attention to visuals\u2014such as cover art and video content\u2014is critical. Effective branding that resonates with the song's message can enhance shareability in a crowded digital space, capitalizing on the short attention spans of today's audience.\n\nOverall, the latest trends underscore the increasing importance of a structured marketing approach that encompasses various digital channels and collaborations to ensure that new music reaches a wide audience effectively. Emerging artists are encouraged to prioritize these strategies to navigate the competitive landscape of the music industry successfully."

For example, on Sept. 19, the Facebook account The Patriots Network posted the following meme , plus a quote from an unidentified source:\nTaylor Swift Banned from Country Music After Big Endorsement: \"She Should Stick to Singing, Not Politics\"\n(The Patriots Network/Facebook)\nAs of this writing, the Facebook post had received 2,400 reactions and 1,000 comments, with users sharing varying opinions on the political implications of Swift's so-called big endorsement. The meme referred to Swift's Sept. 10 endorsement of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election\nOne commenter wrote, \" I'm sure miss Swift is disappointed that 'Nashville's elite' are mad about her endorsement of Harris, but I doubt she will lose any sleep over it. She is a powerful woman, that has always done the right thing, is fair and just in her treatment of others and has literally given millions upon millions to charities and the world. I would dare Trump or any other of the 1% wealthy bigots to match generosity. But they won't, they are using their millions to fly into space, or build aircraft carrier size yachts or purchasing multiple mansions.\"\nAnother commenter responded, \" But it is ok with Kid Rock to endorse Trump. I love those freedom of speach people !\"\nSwift announced her endorsement of Harris via her official Instagram account :\n\n\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)\n\nAt the top of the comments section of The Patriots Network Facebook post, the account's author pinned a comment linking to an article on SpacexMania.com published the same day as the Facebook post. The article offered greater detail about Swift's alleged ouster from the country music community:\nTaylor Swift Banned from Country Music After Big Endorsement: \"She Should Stick to Singing, Not Politics\"\nIn a twist that could have been written in one of her own breakup ballads, country music has seemingly dumped Taylor Swift. Following her high-profile endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, the country music establishment has decided to cut ties with their once-golden girl, leaving her out in the cold. The official line from Nashville? \"She should stick to singing, not politics.\"\nSwift, who became a global superstar through her heartfelt country songs before crossing over into pop stardom, is now facing the ultimate snub from the very industry that helped launch her career. The backlash has been swift (pun intended), with country radio stations quietly pulling her songs from playlists and industry insiders slamming her for stepping into the political ring.\nHowever, there was no evidence to support the claim that Swift has been banned from participating in country music due to her endorsement of Harris for U.S. president. No reputable outlet has reported on this supposed news, and the alleged quotes attributed to Swift by SpaceXMania have not been reported elsewhere .\nRather, the rumor about Swift being ousted by the country music establishment due to her political leanings originated with SpaceXMania.com, a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows:\nWe are a team of writers and editors based in New York, USA. Our mission? To bring you the freshest fake news, some sassy analysis, and a good dose of satire, all rolled into one crazy concoction that orbits around Elon Musk and everything that's lighting up the viral/trending charts.\nIn addition, The Patriots Network Facebook page where the post appeared also had a disclaimer, which read:\nThe Patriots Network is a Network of Satire and Parody affiliated with SpacexMania.com\nAdditionally, in the top-left corner of the Facebook meme, a \"Rated Satire\" badge was clearly visible, while in the bottom-right corner a stamp read, \"This is a 'FICTIONAL QUOTE.'\"\nSnopes has addressed similar satirical claims about Swift and her political preferences in the past, including the assertion that she lost 30 million social media followers after endorsing Harris, and that Coca-Cola ended its partnership with the pop star after she said she would vote for Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\nFor background, here is why we alert readers to rumors created by sources that call their output humorous or satirical.\nSources\nBy Nikki Dobrin\nNikki Dobrin is based in Los Angeles and has previously worked at The Walt Disney Company, as well as written and edited for People, USA Today and The Hill.\nArticle Tags\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2024  by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n",

On September 10, 2024, Swift publicly endorsed U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris for president, a move that has led to widespread rumors and speculative chatter regarding her status in the country music community. Notably, social media discussions ignited when a meme claimed that Swift had been banned from country music following her endorsement, suggesting that the country music establishment is distancing itself from the artist who was once its shining star.\n\nDespite the backlash speculated in various online posts, including those from sources known for satire, credible evidence supporting the claim that Swift has been officially ousted from country music remains nonexistent. Instead, the rumor seems to stem from satirical commentary rather than substantial reporting. The meme in question referenced Swift\u2019s alleged exclusion from playlists on country radio and the disapproval of certain industry insiders, yet these claims have not been corroborated by reputable media sources. \n\nThis development highlights ongoing tensions in the music industry where artists' political engagements can affect their standing within particular genres. The incident serves as a reminder of the intersection between music and politics, particularly in the age of social media where misinformation can spread rapidly.\n\nOverall, this situation signals a growing trend of artists navigating their public personas and political beliefs, which can lead to significant repercussions in their careers, particularly when diametrically opposed to the views of their traditional fan base or industry stakeholders."

There is something going on and it\u2019s not just in entertainment, but entertainment is a really easy industry for these types of individuals to get what they want because you are never told, \u2019No\u2019\u2019.\u201d\nWhile she has chosen not to publicly \u2018out\u2019 her alleged abusers, Jones did say that the entertainment industry is \u2018small and incestuous\u2019.\nWhen she Saw the now viral video of Combs\u2019 kicking and dragging Ventura it outraged her, but also did not surprise her.\n\u201c\u2019I wish I could say I was shocked,\u2019 Jones said of the video footage. \u2018I\u2019m appalled that she was treated that way.

She emphasizes that the accountability must extend beyond Combs to the larger network of executives and producers whom she accuses of enabling such behavior.\n\nAs more artists come forward, the scandal is prompting a significant reckoning, with industry insiders and the public beginning to question the normalized silence around these disturbing practices. This situation appears to highlight a growing movement towards transparency and accountability in the music industry, with Jones urging that change is overdue and essential. \n\nThis evolving narrative indicates a notable trend of artists and performers stepping into the spotlight to share their experiences, which could have profound implications for the music industry as it confronts a legacy of misconduct and seeks to foster a safer and more equitable environment."

Because for four years, I\u2019ve been screaming not just about Diddy, but that Diddy and Jay-Z are monsters, and the victim-making machine kept going on.\nPiers Morgan: Jay-Z has been notable by his silence since these charges were brought against Diddy. Why do you think that is?\nJaguar Wright: Because that\u2019s what he does. He starts little fires everywhere and forces everyone involved to carry water while he sneaks away without a response. That changes now. Shawn, you must respond. You have no choice. Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Robert [R.] Kelly, Sean [Diddy] Combs\u2014they all have one person in common, professionally and privately: Shawn Carter [Jay Z] . This has been a fist of tyranny punching through our culture and society for decades. It must stop.\nPiers Morgan: There\u2019s been a lot of talk about cruelty-free artistry. There\u2019s also been a lot of rumors about what has happened in the rap world, especially allegations that the misogyny in the lyrics reflects a general misogyny toward women outside of music. And that seems to have been borne out by these charges against Diddy. If he\u2019s found guilty of all this, he\u2019s never coming out of prison. How dangerous do you think he is as a person?\nJaguar Wright: I think he\u2019s one of the most dangerous people I\u2019ve ever met\u2026 Everyone knew he was the devil, and he\u2019s been the devil for 30 years. He\u2019s been covered and protected\u2026 He was selected to be the demon he is, to keep the culture in line so the industry could continue to exploit it for all of its precious jewels. The list of lost souls is ridiculous, and everyone knows Diddy was chosen for this job.\nDuring the interview, Wright also accused Jay-Z of orchestrating efforts to eliminate controversial figures like R. Kelly. According to her, Jay-Z played a crucial role in the #MeToo movement\u2019s takedown of R. Kelly, not for justice but to protect his own interests.\nJaguar Wright: The #MeToo movement was a ruse, a setup, a scam. I\u2019m saying that publicly now. Dream Hampton spearheaded the #SurvivingRKelly campaign, which fueled the #MeToo campaign. And that was all funded by Shawn Carter to make sure Robert Kelly went to jail.\n\u2026They were able to gather all those witnesses because Jay-Z was there with Robert Kelly\u2026 It\u2019s insane that people refuse to see what\u2019s right in front of them. If the #MeToo movement were real, why aren\u2019t they speaking out now? They\u2019ve been very quiet during the downfall of these predators\u2014maybe they\u2019re all on vacation.\nPiers Morgan: If this goes to court, Jaguar, do you think the world will be shocked by what comes out?\nJaguar Wright: Oh, absolutely. I just don\u2019t know why they would be. It\u2019s been happening in front of everyone\u2019s faces for decades.\nWright also claimed to have spoken with \u201chundreds\u201d of victims, stating she currently assists three individuals who are willing to testify against both Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9.\nShe alleged that Beyonc\u00e9 has been complicit in her husband\u2019s actions, engaging in behavior that she described as \u201cnasty.\u201d\nPiers Morgan: How many victims potentially do you think there could be?\nTrending: KAMALA IS KOLLAPSING: A Visibly Exhausted Kamala Harris Was on Stage in Detroit For Only Six Minutes, 36 Seconds\u2026 And Lizzo Never Performed! (VIDEO)\nJaguar Wright: Thousands\u2026 I\u2019ve talked to hundreds who I still help myself. I have three victims right now who are willing to give testimony about not only what Mr. Carter has done to them, but also about his wife. They\u2019re a nasty little couple.

During a heated interview with Piers Morgan, Wright accused the influential couple of serious misconduct, labeling Jay-Z a \"monster\" and claiming they have harmed numerous individuals. She alleges that hundreds of victims are poised to come forward with testimonies against them, positioned as part of a broader \"victim-making machine.\"\n\nWright, who has previously spoken out against figures like Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u2014currently embroiled in a sex trafficking investigation\u2014reiterated her stance on the systemic issues in the industry, suggesting that Jay-Z played a manipulative role in the downfall of R. Kelly as part of self-interest rather than a genuine pursuit of justice.\n\nThe conversation also highlighted broader themes of misogyny and exploitation within the music business, linking them to a culture that has often overlooked the troubling behaviors of its major figures. Notably, Wright claims to currently assist three victims willing to testify against Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, indicating that the upcoming weeks could see significant developments if these allegations are pursued legally.\n\nOverall, this controversy signals a critical moment for the music industry, where allegations of past conduct by high-profile artists could reshape public perception and prompt a reevaluation of accountability within the industry."

And it took me back,\" Morvan said in an Oct. 14 interview on TODAY.\nOverall streams for Milli Vanilli's entire catalog has increased 114% since the release of the series, according to Billboard . Three of the group's songs are highlighted in moments of the show, including a prominent scene where Nicholas Chavez and Cooper Koch , portraying Lyle and Erik Menendez, respectively, sing \"Blame It on the Rain\" in a car.\nLyle and Erik Menendez were convicted of killing their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez , with shotguns on a summer night in 1989. The events leading up to and the aftermath of the murders are depicted in the new Netflix series.\nStreams of \"Blame It on the Rain\" increased 68% in the four-day period following the series premiere on Netflix on Sept. 19, according to Billboard.\nAnother prominent scene in the first episode of the series is at the memorial service for Jose Menendez , where the brothers arrive in a stretch limousine and Lyle Menendez gives a lengthy eulogy for this father, while showing little to no emotion about his death .\nIn the series, Lyle Menendez ends his speech by playing the Milli Vanilli song, \"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You,\" to questionable looks from attendees of the memorial service.\nJournalist Robert Rand wrote in his book \"The Menendez Murders\" that the Milli Vanilli track was in fact played toward the end of the service.\nStreams of \"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You\" jumped 258% in the four-day period following the release of the series, according to Billboard. The other Milli Vanilli track played in the episode, \"Girl You Know It's True,\" increased by 32.5% over the same period.\nAnd the songs have continued to chart since \u2014 \"Blame It on the Rain\" debuted at No. 34 on the Billboard TikTok Top 50 chart for the week of Oct. 12, and \"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You\" came in just behind at No. 37.\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited that those songs (are), like, getting more attention,\u201d Morvan said.\nMilli Vanilli's renewed success has put a spotlight on the group, which rose to fame with the release of their debut record, \"Girl You Know It's True,\" in the U.S. in 1989, which went on to be six-time platinum certified by the RIAA.\nThe band's popularity led them to win the Grammy for Best New Artist in 1990, though the band returned the award nine months later due to a lip-syncing scandal.\nDuring a performance broadcast on MTV , Morvan and Pilatus rushed off stage while the recording of \"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You\" malfunctioned. The group eventually admitted they never sang a note on their debut record, according to Biography .\n\"People were brutal,\" Morvan said on TODAY. \"We had no we had no understanding of the industry. You know, we just fell into the trap.\"\nMilli Vanilli's other member Pilatus died in 1998 of a suspected drug overdose, reported the Associated Press .\nMorvan reflected on Milli Vanilli's history as the group finds newfound success with younger generations.\n\"I know what Milli Vanilli did, and still does. It makes people feel, it makes people smile,\" Morvan said.\nAnna Kaplan is a news and trending reporter for TODAY.com.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n",

You\u2019ll never get through the tens of millions of songs in the Spotify catalog. You can, though, spend the rest of your life listening to brand-new music.\nAll those choices can also make it challenging to figure out what you should actually queue up next in your playlists. Still, Spotify has plenty of features to help you might not have realized just how many ways there are to discover new music on this platform. These are the best ones.\n1) Ask AI to make a playlist\nWe\u2019ll start with one of Spotify\u2019s newest features, AI Playlist. It\u2019s only available in the mobile app for Premium users. It takes text prompts (like bots such as ChatGPT) and turns them into custom playlists.\nSo, you might ask for a queue of songs you\u2019ve never heard, but that sums up the early 90s rock scene in the US. Or, you could ask for tracks to accompany an evening jog. From the Your Library tab, tap the + (plus) icon, then choose AI Playlist from the list.\n2) Browse through your daily mixes\nOpen the Spotify app or web player\u2019s home screen, and you\u2019ll see the streaming service serves up multiple daily mixes for you. These cover all aspects of your music listening history and are usually themed around particular artists or music genres.\nClick on any of the mixes to start listening\u2014you should get a mix of new stuff and music you\u2019ve heard. If you hear something you like, save it to another playlist because your daily mixes will be refreshed in the next 24 hours.\n3) Create blends with friends\nRecommendations from friends are a fine way to discover new music, and while we might not have mixtapes anymore, we do have Spotify\u2019s Blend feature. It combines your tastes with other people\u2019s tastes in a single playlist you can share.\nIn the desktop app, click the search box at the top of the screen, then choose Made For You and Create a Blend to get started . Then, via the Invite link, you can select the other people you want to tap for music recommendations (you can invite up to 10 people).\n4) Use the AI DJ\nAnother option courtesy of artificial intelligence: If you click in the search box at the top of the desktop app interface and then choose Made For You and DJ , you\u2019ll get a custom mix of old and new songs curated by AI (complete with DJ-like comments between songs).\nIf something comes up that\u2019s not your jam, you can always click on the DJ button just to the right of the playback controls to have the AI pick something else. It works better than expected, including the AI chat, but it is exclusive to Premium users.\n5) Find playlists made by others\nYou may not have noticed if you\u2019ve been buried in your own Spotify library. Still, plenty of people who use the streaming platform put out public playlists for other listeners to queue up\u2014and they can be a really useful way of discovering new tracks you\u2019ve never heard.\nClick in the search box at the top of the desktop app interface and search for anything you like. It could be an artist, a genre, a decade, a mood, or anything you like. Choose Playlists underneath, and scroll down to see some of the Spotify community\u2019s mixes.\n6) Add to your current playlists\nLoad any of your playlists in the Spotify desktop interface, scroll down to the bottom, and you should see a selection of recommended tracks to add to the end of the playlist\u2014songs based on the artists, genre, and mood of the current selection.\nSome of these tracks will be plucked from your existing Spotify library, but you\u2019ll also encounter some new stuff. It works well because the picks will match what you\u2019ve already chosen, so the extra songs won\u2019t break the vibe of the playlist.\n7) Discovery new music every week\nYou may have missed it amid everything that Spotify serves up, but it produces a playlist of 30 new songs every Monday. They\u2019re all tracks you haven\u2019t heard before, and all the picks are based on what you\u2019ve listened to.\nThis is one of the oldest ways to discover new music on Spotify, and it remains one of the best, too. As with the daily mixes, if you come across something you like, remember to save it to your library or to another playlist before the recommended mix is refreshed.\nSPOTIFY\nDaily Newsletter\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\nYou May Also Like\nTrump Spends 39 Minutes on Stage Listening to His Beloved Spotify Playlist\nAfter two people in the crowd fainted, Trump decided to turn his latest rally into a 'music fest.'\nSpotify\u2019s New Offline Backup Playlists Will Be a Game Changer for Frequent Flyers\nYou won't have to manually create offline playlists anymore.\nSpotify Says Apple No Longer Allows for Physical Volume Controls on iPhone Connected Devices\nSpotify says it's working with Apple on a solution, but for now you have to use a newly added\u00a0volume slider on the app.\nThe DNC\u2019s 2024 \u2018Roll Call\u2019 Playlist Is on Spotify\n\"Lose Yourself,\" \"Empire State of Mind,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Shipping up to Boston\u201d were just some of the song played during the Roll Call.\nHow to Improve Your Spotify Recommendations\nHere's how to get the Spotify algorithm to work in your favor and get recommended music you actually want to listen to.\nGoogle Gemini Might Soon Question Your Taste in Music\nA Spotify extension for Google Gemini has been spotted in a teardown, hinting on being able to play music via AI.\n\nDiscover the Winners of the 2024 Gizmodo Science Fair \u279c\nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites. \u00a92024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

                  "text_content": "TikTok has admitted defeat in music streaming\nTikTok is shutting down its music-streaming app, TikTok Music , on November 28.\nThe app, which blends social features with music streaming , first launched in July 2023 in Indonesia and Brazil, later expanding into Singapore, Australia, and Mexico a couple of weeks later. It never arrived in the US, despite the company filing a trademark application for the name in 2022.\n\"We will be closing TikTok Music at the end of November in order to focus on our goal of furthering TikTok's role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry,\" Ole Obermann, TikTok's global head of music business development, told Business Insider in a statement.\nTikTok Music's shuttering marks the end of a four-year experiment in streaming by the company's owner, ByteDance. Before the launch of TikTok Music, ByteDance ran a similar music-streaming app called Resso in India, Indonesia, and Brazil.\nIt's unclear how successful TikTok Music was at building a user base in the five countries where it launched. On Apple's app store, TikTok Music is the 28th most popular music-streaming app in Indonesia and the 71st most popular in Brazil. Currently, the app doesn't rank in the top 100 among music apps in the other countries where it operates.\nThe decision to get into the crowded streaming business made sense for TikTok, even if it was ambitious. The company had spent years establishing itself as an important platform for music discovery . Songs that go viral on TikTok often chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and Spotify Viral 50. Why not send those TikTok music fans to a streaming app it owns?\nRelated stories\nThe company has a dedicated music team that focuses on working with artists and labels, as well as finding new ways to make money. Outside of launching a music streamer, TikTok built a song-distribution tool called SoundOn, partnered with SiriusXM on a radio station , hosted its own live music concert, and worked closely with major artists on song and album promotions.\nBut TikTok's relationship with the music industry hasn't always been rainbows and unicorns. The company went to war with Universal Music Group over a contract dispute earlier this year. Some of its experiments in the music business, such as hiring A&R staffers, have also edged into record labels' territory .\nUltimately, a lot of the company's battles with the industry came down to money. Its music-streaming app presented an opportunity for TikTok to feed revenue back to rights holders, incentivizing artists and labels to provide access to songs on its main app (a partnership strategy that YouTube pioneered around a decade ago).\nStill, the music industry is unlikely to shy away from TikTok any time soon. TikTok is a hit-maker, and any savvy music marketer will continue to use the platform to make songs trend.\nGoing forward, the company will likely focus on its \"Add To Music App\" feature, which lets TikTok users add songs or pre-save tracks they hear on TikTok to other streaming services like Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music.\nRead next\nWatch: TikTok could be banned in US after House vote\nJump to\n",

The music streaming app will feature Offline Backup: an offline playlist automatically generated based on your recently streamed tracks.\nYes, Spotify already allows offline playlists, but users must manually download every track that goes in. The new feature will ensure an offline playlist has been auto-created for you. It will appear on your feed like a regular playlist, and you can add it to your library, too.\nOffline Backup was released in beta last year and has officially rolled out today for Premium Spotify users on iOS and Android, including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay worldwide.\nI eagerly look forward to how much time and effort this feature will save. I wasn\u2019t a fan of offline playlists simply because manually hand-picking everything I\u2019d want to listen to on an hours-long flight would be my last priority while packing for a trip. Also, music tastes and song preferences are ever-evolving, so having a single offline playlist for every flight is difficult.\nThe best thing about Offline Backup is that it knows what you\u2019ve been listening to lately and will evolve with your music taste. Feeding your preferences in real-time will ensure that it caters to your streaming choices. It also allows filtering, so you can easily sort through the playlist by looking up the artist, genre, or even mood.\nIf your app is up to date, Offline Backup will automatically show up on your feed. Spotify requires only that you have recently listened to more than five songs and have offline listening enabled. You can do the latter by going into Settings on the Spotify app > Data Saving > Offline or Storage. Then, navigate to the Offline Listening toggle on this page and turn it on.\nSpotify has recently been experimenting with hands-off, minimal-effort playlist creation. Just last week, its AI playlist builder became available in the US, which allows users to create a custom playlist based on a prompt. The app was seen toying with the feature in October of last year, and it was released in beta in April this year and for the US, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand in September .\nRewinding a little more will take you back to one of the earliest Spotify AI features, the AI DJ, unveiled in August 2023. Though that wasn\u2019t the biggest hit among the community (we weren\u2019t the biggest fans of it either), we\u2019re looking forward to seeing how helpful Offline Backup actually proves to be.\nMusic music streaming playlists SPOTIFY\nDaily Newsletter\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\nYou May Also Like\nTrump Spends 39 Minutes on Stage Listening to His Beloved Spotify Playlist\nAfter two people in the crowd fainted, Trump decided to turn his latest rally into a 'music fest.'\nListen to Green Day\u2019s Best Song on a Big Mouth Billie Bass\nOr, try your luck with a wax cylinder copy of 'When I Come Around.'\n7 Ways to Find New Music You\u2019ll Like on Spotify\nChange up your music mixes with ease.\nNew Mozart Just Dropped: Lost Manuscript Reveals Centuries-Old Music\nThe young Mozart composed the piece around 1760 and was played for the first time at the Leipzig Opera over the weekend.\nSpotify Says Apple No Longer Allows for Physical Volume Controls on iPhone Connected Devices\nSpotify says it's working with Apple on a solution, but for now you have to use a newly added\u00a0volume slider on the app.\nThe DNC\u2019s 2024 \u2018Roll Call\u2019 Playlist Is on Spotify\n\"Lose Yourself,\" \"Empire State of Mind,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Shipping up to Boston\u201d were just some of the song played during the Roll Call.\n\nDiscover the Winners of the 2024 Gizmodo Science Fair \u279c\nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites. \u00a92024 GIZMODO USA LLC.
